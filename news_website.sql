Perth won a competition to become Scotland\\\'s 7th city to mark the Queen\\\'s Diamond Jubilee, and now hopes to repeat its success.Here are eight reasons why Perth is already a Scottish cultural hub. Born in Perth, the Trainspotting star gained recognition for his portrayal of heroin addict Renton in the on-screen adaptation of Irvine Welsh\\\'s novel.McGregor went on to star in a variety of blockbusters including Moulin Rouge and the Star Wars prequels, where he played a young Obi-Wan Kenobi.His love of motorbikes led him to create travel documentary The Long Way round with Charley Boorman, which followed them across thirteen countries as they travelled from London to New York. Perth-born Fred MacAulay started his comedy career late at the tender age of 31, after first training to be an accountant.He is now a frequent and popular performer at Edinburgh\\\'s Fringe Festival and a variety of international comedy festivals. The comedian hosted his own radio show MacAulay and co for almost 18 years on BBC Radio Scotland, and has made appearances on comedy panel shows including QI and Have I Got News For You. The Scottish baritone made his Royal Opera debut in 1987 and has since enjoyed critical acclaim.The Perth singer is a former member of the Scottish Opera, Welsh National Opera and a host of international opera companies. Maxwell has portrayed leading roles in productions of Madam Butterfly, Otello, Carmen and La Boheme, to name a few. The former PE teacher from Perth won silver medals in the 400m hurdles at two Commonwealth Games, most notably at Glasgow 2014. She was both hurdles European Champion and Scottish Athlete of the year in 2014.Recently, Doyle suffered a devastating defeat by finishing in last place during the 400m hurdles at the Rio Olympics final.The curling star was skip of the Scottish team that won the 2011 European Championships in Moscow and the 2013 World Championships in Riga.As part of Team GB, Muirhead went on to win bronze at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi and held the title of 2013 World Champion. Perth\\\'s Mark Beaumont first rose to fame when he completed an 18,000 mile round-the-world bike trek, where he beat the world record by a staggering 82 days.Beaumont is also a television presenter, broadcaster, author and endurance adventurer who has made documentaries in more than 100 countries.The Glenturret Distillery, just outside of Perth in Crieff, is where Scotland\\\'s favourite Famous Grouse Whisky is made. Glenturret is Scotland\\\'s oldest working distillery, and it offers hourly tours and tasting experiences for visitors. Scotland\\\'s largest export is still a popular draw for tourists and locals, and the Famous Grouse experience won Whisky Visitor Attraction of the Year 2015. The iconic installation that covered the Tower of London with poppies in 2014 is now housed at the Black Watch Castle and Museum in Perth. Thousands of hand made ceramic poppies were created by artist Paul Cummins and designer Tom Piper to mark the centenary of World War One.The Weeping Window is touring the country, but will remain in Perth until 25 September.

It is far more subtle than a headline claiming a Scot is losing out to someone from England, Wales or Northern Ireland. It is the price of free tuition at Scottish university - a price the policy\\\'s supporters would say was worth paying.To put this in context though, the number of places at Scottish universities available to Scots is at an historic high. By this week the number of Scottish applicants accepted to Scottish institutions had reached 30,400 - 4% up on this time last year.However, this may be little consolation to those who have lost out on the course they actually wanted to do.Essentially there are now three groups of students at Scottish universities.This two tier system for Scottish and other UK students is the result of free tuition in Scotland. But universities strongly contend that comparing students in the different categories is like comparing apples with pears. They deny claims Scots are losing out to fee-paying students from elsewhere and say this shows a misunderstanding of the issue.Realistically the only way to end the distinction would be if tuition fees were re-introduced in Scotland or if free tuition was brought back in other parts of the UK.The former would mean Scottish universities would be free to take in as many Scots as they wanted.  The latter could end the distinction in the clearing system. Either would probably mean that there was no hard and fast distinction between Scottish applicants and prospective students from other parts of Britain. Universities Scotland is calling for discussions with the government over the total number of places available to Scots. It would like to see the overall number grow to ensure that more people from disadvantaged areas can get a place without making it harder for others.

The last Fifie sailed just hours after the new bridge opened and was overseen by relief skipper John Lewis Squibb.His daughter Margaret Wright said: \"That was quite a sad day, especially for my dad. \"The ferry was doing the last crossing to Dundee and my dad was able to throw the last rope onto the boat before it took off. \"It was a lovely evening and the whole family was there which made it very special.  \"I think he was very emotional, but progress, it was what was needed.\"The ferries could not take the quantity of traffic that was coming in. \"We needed the bridge.\"Although work on the \\xc2\\xa34.8m bridge began in March 1963, there had been an appetite for such a crossing for decades.Eventually, in 1958, test bores were taken and a traffic census was carried out, before William A Fairhurst\\\'s design was given the go-ahead two years later.The construction involved a low temporary bridge which allowed the digging of coffer dams for the road bridge\\\'s pillars. Conditions could be harsh and five men died in the bridge\\\'s construction, with three men lost when part of the temporary bridge collapsed in November 1965.Bert Smith was due to work that evening but swapped his shift with John McQueen, one of the men who died.He said:  \"I didn\\\'t want to work that night because my wife wasn\\\'t well, so I got a change with John McQueen. \"So I went home that night and it was not long after that, that the incident happened.\"He was killed when it should have been me. It still brings the hair up on the back of my neck yet, it really does. \"I think about them every November.\"Mr Smith worked on the bridge for the whole of its three-and-a-half year construction.He said:  \"It was a hard job, just because of the nature of the job. You had to be fit and able to work. \"It\\\'s a nice strong bridge. \"There\\\'s no reason for it not being there in 100 years time, because I remember all the piles that went into the foundation and the amount of concrete and steelwork that was involved.\" In July 1966, the final girder was put in place and the Tay Road Bridge was complete.Spanning 1.4 miles, the bridge rose from a height of 32 feet above sea level at Dundee to 125ft at Newport-on-Tay.A viewing platform sat atop the toll booths, a feature of the bridge until tolls were abolished in 2008.The five men who perished in the bridge\\\'s construction, along with William Logan, managing director of the main building contractor, who died in a plane crash in January 1966, are commemorated in memorial plaques beside the bridge.Current bridge manager Alan Hutchison said it had become a \"major piece of Scottish heritage transport infrastructure\".\"It\\\'s been incredibly important when you consider the links it\\\'s created,\" he said.Currently carrying 26,000 vehicles a day, anticipated traffic on the bridge in 1966 was less than a fifth of that figure.Mr Hutchison said the crossing has weathered the rigours of half a century of traffic \"incredibly well\".He said: \"We now get 44-tonne European lorries and a few years ago the bridge was strengthened to accommodate the additional loading from these.\"So, with regular maintenance and inspections, it will continue to cope very well indeed.\"Supervisor Jim McDonald, who has worked on the bridge for 34 years, oversees these inspections. He recalled one of the bridge\\\'s more unusual travellers, a runaway bull called Bertie which escaped from a nearby abattoir in July, 2000. \"They nicknamed it Houdini because it escaped over a six-foot wall,\" he said.\"The abattoir was about half a mile from the bridge and it came onto the ramp and went on the northbound approach before they darted it.\"The bull was captured after making it to Fife and following a plea for mercy by TV comedy writer Carla Lane, it was transferred to her animal sanctuary in West Sussex.Mr McDonald also remembers the legendary Tay Road Bridge Jif lemon tree, where plastic lemons were placed on a tree beside the toll booths by workers for almost three decades. He said: \"It was just for fun to keep people\\\'s spirits up and all the children liked it. \"Every year we\\\'d put them out in April and then in October or November, you\\\'d bring them in again.\"Some people thought it was a real lemon tree and would take photos of it.\"The trees and the tolls are no more - but the bridge is still going strong fifty years on.A weekend of celebrations will take place in Dundee and Fife to mark the anniversary.A mural designed by Fraser Gray and Martin McGuinness, which includes a portrait of William Fairhurst is being painted underneath the Dundee bridge approach road.Alan Hutchison said: \"The Tay Road Bridge is an incredibly well-maintained bridge. \"When bridges are designed they typically have what engineers call the design life of 120 years.\"We\\\'re only 50 years into that, but there\\\'s no reason why it won\\\'t go on forever.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-tayside-central-37037733','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-18 07:36:50',1),(22,'Pupular attractions','Top 10 weird and wonderful picks for people looking for a day out with a difference.','Doors Open Days, getting under way next month, will allow free public access to rare historic sites across Scotland.

An internal report seen by the New York Times is said to have led to the shift. But the UN still says it is protected by diplomatic immunity from claims for compensation from victims\\\' families.On Thursday, Farhan Haq, a spokesman for UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, said that \"over the past year the UN has become convinced it needs to do much more regarding its own involvement in the initial outbreak and the suffering of those affected by cholera\".However, Mr Haq reiterated that the UN\\\'s legal position in on diplomatic immunity and possible compensation \"has not changed\".His comments came after the confidential internal report stated that the epidemic \"would not have broken out but for the actions of the United Nations,\" It says the report was sent to Mr Ban last week by long-time UN adviser Philip Alston, a New York University law professor who consults the world body on human rights issues.

His standing was greatly boosted by the three World Cups Brazil won under his control as Brazilian Sports Confederation president, and the former Olympian adroitly exploited the issue and pledged to kick out South Africa if he took control. There were other promises to the continent as well: An expanded World Cup, new youth tournaments and, among others, developmental help. So, after his election, it was time to give back. With Rous out of the way, Havelange dealt with South Africa fairly swiftly, expelling the country from Fifa in 1976, a ban which lasted until 1992, as the end of apartheid neared. He also introduced junior tournaments - handing Tunisia the first hosting rights, in 1977, for what is called the Under-20 World Cup today. Eight years later, he ensured Africa had the same representation as Europe and South America in the Under-17 World Cup, in contrast to the senior World Cup, as the tournament launched in 1985. He was slightly hamstrung with his World Cup offer despite overseeing vast global expansion - having partnered with Horst Dassler, the son of the Adidas founder and the father of sports sponsorship. With the help of improving television broadcast technology and football\\\'s hugely attractive lure for sponsors, the pair greatly enhanced football\\\'s global reach, Fifa\\\'s coffers and - as has been well documented - Africa was not a huge market for sponsors at the time though and had to patiently wait for its World Cup places to increase from one to two in 1982, when the finals expanded from 16 to 24 teams. In the interim, Havelange offered a host of developmental programmes and increased funding. Fifa\\\'s finances had previously been so threadbare Rous had been limited on one occasion to handing out 20 footballs to one African country.Today, each African country receives $500,000 (\\xc2\\xa3380,000) a year as a continuation of the funding grants initiated by Havelange. A year after his election, Havelange chose someone who came to love African football (and its voting power) to head Fifa\\\'s global developmental work: Sepp Blatter. In 1976, the Fifa technical director\\\'s first overseas trip was to Ethiopia where he ran an administrative course. When the Swiss protege replaced Havelange in the 1998 Fifa elections, he continued to assist Africa in a variety of ways. Prominent among them was the change to Fifa\\\'s method of determining a World Cup host, a decision taken to ensure that Africa got the World Cup, having controversially missed out on the 2006 finals. As the 2010 finals kicked off in South Africa, the work started by Havelange in Africa had reached its current zenith. Like the organisation he led for so long, Havelange was far from faultless but his campaign manifesto forced him to help Africa - which he did, despite various delays. Today, the five World Cup places that he awarded Africa during his reign is the tally the continent still holds.

Her story illustrates just how much power lies in the hands of armed men in Colombia - despite a ceasefire by the left-wing Farc rebels - and how lawless some parts of the country remain.A statuesque Afro-Colombian woman wearing a bright turban and loose flowing robes hovers over her patient and gently prods his stomach. \"Where does it hurt?\" she asks the man who is lying on his back in a room filled with plants and brightly coloured posters. She uses traditional medicine made from roots and seeds to heal her patients at the Armed Conflict Victims Centre in a rundown suburb of Bogota. People come to this state-run clinic to share their stories and get some relief from the suffering they have endured in a war between left-wing guerrillas and the army, which has lasted for more than half a century. Maria, the healer in the turban, is herself recovering from a terrible ordeal, which led to her being driven from her home. Like one in every 10 Colombians, she has become a refugee in her own country. Nearly seven million people have been uprooted and more than 220,000 killed since 1964 when the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc), took up arms against the state to demand social equality and land reform. And although the Farc has agreed a ceasefire and there is a hope for an end to the insurgency, other armed groups, including right-wing paramilitaries, still terrorise large areas of the country.At her small flat over a car repairs shop Maria tells me her story. Six years ago she was living 400 miles away in Quibdo, capital of the department of Choco, in the west of Colombia, one of the poorest regions of the country where most of the population is descended from African slaves brought over by Spanish colonisers.  Maria was a leader in a women\\\'s group called AfroMuPaz which supports families displaced by conflict. She also campaigned against the recruitment of child soldiers by the many armed groups active in the region and denounced them for subjecting women and girls to sexual abuse. Criss-crossed with rivers and bordering both the Caribbean and Pacific coasts, Choco has long been a battleground for those fighting to control drug-trafficking routes and access to illegal gold mines, and they have preyed on local women. AfroMuPaz was one of the few groups speaking out about the problem and calling for it to stop.In July 2010, a man came to see Maria and said he wanted to donate some children\\\'s clothes and shoes to her group. He offered to take her to another neighbourhood to collect them. \"So I climbed into his truck suspecting nothing,\" she says. \"But when we started driving out of the city I felt uneasy and asked where the donation was. At that point someone pointed a gun at me and pulled a hood over my head.\"Maria was driven into the jungle and when her captors took off the hood she saw she was surrounded by armed men. Then, to her horror, she saw a soldier leading her 13-year-old daughter out of a hut.   Maria\\\'s daughter, Camila, had been lured into a car by a female member of the Los Rastrojos paramilitary group who told her she was taking her to meet her mother. \"But we were both kidnapped,\" says Maria. Officially these right-wing militias no longer exist. They were demobilised a decade ago but many have resurfaced or mutated into criminal gangs. Originally under an umbrella group, the AUC (At nightfall, the teenager was led away and Maria was tied to a tree with three men guarding her. She was covered in blood from blows to her head. \"At first I thought they were going to kill me,\" she says. \"Then one of them told me they were going to punish me for talking too much. They started showing me their genitals and I realised what they were going to do. I started screaming: \\\'OK do whatever you have to do to me but please don\\\'t touch my kid. Don\\\'t touch my daughter!\\\'\"Maria was raped repeatedly by five men over five days. At one point she fainted - and when she woke up she was in a Quibdo hospital. She had been found on the side of the road after her eldest daughter raised the alarm and search parties went out looking for her.   Camila, Maria\\\'s youngest daughter had been returned to the family home, deeply traumatised but physically unhurt. \"They\\\'d told her that if she breathed a word of what had happened, they\\\'d come back and kill me,\" says Maria. \"So she stopped speaking altogether. For a very long time she only said \\\'yes\\\' or \\\'no\\\' and almost every day she cried.\"Maria gradually recovered and six months later she resumed her work for AfroMuPaz. But one morning a member of the same paramilitary group came to her house and told her she had 48 hours to leave town. \"I just knew I had to go,\" she says.  Maria resettled in the capital, Bogota, where the authorities gave her a bullet-proof vest, a mobile phone and a monthly budget for taxis, as she was warned against taking public transport. Several months later, she was joined by her three children.According to Hector Fabio Henao, a Catholic bishop who played a leading role in the peace process between the Colombian government and the Farc, armed groups are increasingly targeting people like Maria, who speak out against them, or champion causes that conflict with their interests.In one four-week period earlier this year, 13 human rights activists, environmental campaigners and community leaders from indigenous tribes were assassinated, he says.Last year one was being murdered every five days. The killers included members of paramilitary groups, criminal gangs and the ELN (National Liberation Army) - left-wing guerrillas who unlike Farc have not agreed a ceasefire.\"People involved in drug trafficking and illegal gold mining don\\\'t want people around trying to protect the environment,\" says Msgr Henao. \"They don\\\'t want people who speak up for the indigenous population or people who denounce sexual violence, so they control the population with private armies.\"The government and the Farc have agreed on the creation of a special tribunal to investigate and prosecute human rights violations committed during the last 50 years of conflict - they have promised that perpetrators of sexual violence, including rape, will not be eligible for amnesty.  In addition, at the end of last month the government announced that a commission on gender issues had been set up to ensure women\\\'s suffering was recognised and that their voices would be heard. \"We are aware that the conflict has shown no mercy on women, bringing about unimaginable horrors,\" said the Colombian government\\\'s lead negotiator, Humberto de la Calle.Maria is not confident that it will be safe to testify, however. After all, she and others were targeted precisely because they reported abuses.Maria\\\'s daughter, Camila, who temporarily lost the power of speech after she was abducted, is now studying law at university and seems more optimistic about the return of the rule of law. She says she wants to become a politician. \"But a good one!\" she adds. \"Not a corrupt one, who makes ordinary people poorer.\"Maria is finding it harder than her children to adjust to life in Bogota. She is homesick for her ageing mother, her friends and the sense of purpose she felt in her old job.   But working as a healer boosts her morale and helps to diminish \"the anger and hatred\" inside her.   \"I can\\\'t change what happened to me,\" she says.  \"I am not able to forget because my body reminds me of it every day.\"She does try to think about forgiveness and to imagine what it might be like to live in a peaceful country. She also dreams of returning to Quibdo. \"When will that be?\" she says. \"I wish I could go back tomorrow, but I just don\\\'t know.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37107399','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-18 07:27:41',1),(29,'Next moves','Cuba has its own stake in the outcome of the US election as it looks towards better relations','A year has passed since one of the most symbolic moments in the long and tangled history between the United States and Cuba: the official reopening of the long-shuttered US embassy in Havana.On a stiflingly hot August morning, the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, presided over the flag-raising ceremony and the speeches laden with pomp, emotion and bold statements of intent to move on from the hostilities of the past.Since that day, a lot has happened between the former Cold War foes. Direct flights are due to begin this month, travel restrictions have been eased for US citizens and bilateral cooperation increased in science and the arts. Plus of course, there was a historic visit by President Obama. \"I have come here to extend the hand of friendship to the Cuban people,\" he told the nation in a televised address. But while many Cubans would happily accept another four years of Mr Obama, a new administration in Washington is coming. And the outcome could have a significant impact on the new spirit of cordiality between the two countries.\"Obviously the big problem in US-Cuban relations is the embargo. That is the elephant in the room,\" says Carlos Azugaray, a former Cuban diplomat. He says the key to the next phase of United States\\\' normalisation with Cuba has to be the lifting of the decades-long economic embargo on the island: \"The elephant has already started to leave the room, you already have the trunk out! \"We can see that with the recent opening of a Sheraton hotel in Havana, with the decision that some US credit cards can be used in Cuba, that travel restrictions have been eased.\" If the Democratic Party regains control of Congress, he argues, they are \"bound to do something about the embargo\".But most attention is on the race for the White House. So how would a Clinton or a Trump presidency affect the rapprochement with Cuba?\"I understand the scepticism in this community about any policy of engagement towards Cuba,\" Hillary Clinton recently told an audience in Miami. \"I\\\'ve been sceptical too. But we can\\\'t wait any longer for a failed policy to bear fruit. We have to seize this moment.\"The embargo on Cuba is obsolete she told them and needs to go \"once and for all\".Whereas previously those sentiments might have spelt the end of a presidential candidate\\\'s hopes in Florida, in this election they were greeted with applause - admittedly among a select audience - in Miami. However in Cuba, where people have long called for the embargo to be lifted and where the benefits of such a change in policy would actually be felt, many ordinary Cubans don\\\'t entirely trust Mrs Clinton. Cubans remember how she supported her husband\\\'s decision to tighten restrictions on the island in 1996, including signing a measure that meant lifting the embargo must be approved by the US Congress. Carlos Azugaray estimates that the \"votes may be there\" in the US House of Representatives to approve lifting the decades-long sanctions. But unless she can secure them, Hillary Clinton probably can\\\'t expect to receive the same warmth in Cuba that Barack Obama has enjoyed. As for Mr Trump, his foreign policy position on the question of Cuba isn\\\'t entirely clear yet. However it may come as little surprise that he differs from many in his party on the issue. In a televised debate on CNN earlier this year, he did say he was \"somewhere in the middle\" between President Obama\\\'s policy of engagement and Senator Marco Rubio\\\'s outright opposition to talking to the Castro government: \"I don\\\'t agree with President Obama,\" he said, \"but I do agree that something should take place. After 50 years, it\\\'s enough time folks!\"Pushed on whether that would mean he\\\'d row back Mr Obama\\\'s policies, and even close the US embassy in Havana, or continue towards further rapprochement, Donald Trump opted for the former: \"I would probably have the embassy closed until such time as a really good deal was made and struck by the United States,\" he said.The first people affected by such a radical step would be the diplomats in Havana themselves. The candidates\\\' positions on CubaHillary Clinton:Donald Trump:The US Charge d\\\'Affaires in Cuba is Jeffrey de Laurentis. I asked him about the potential consequences of the US presidential election on the relationship with Cuba, during an interview at the end of last year.He said: \"My wish is that when the campaign is over and the election is over and whoever is elected president is in the White House, he or she will recognise the value of the direction we\\\'ve taken and wish to continue it.\"For the time being the Cuban diplomats are staying similarly tight-lipped. Josefina Vidal heads the US affairs department at the Cuban Foreign Ministry. \"We expect that whomever is the next president of the United States will take into consideration what the majority of the American public and the majority of the Cuban-American population in the US thinks about this,\" she told the BBC, adding that the polls show they are in favour of the normalisation of relations.Former diplomat, Carlos Azugaray, can speak a little more freely about the prospect of a billionaire conservative businessman as the next president. He sees two key problems with Mr Trump from a Cuban perspective: \"Unpredictability: we cannot say that what he says is what he thinks. And the other thing is how far he will want to take his independence from the leadership of the Republican Party.\"Ironically, as Cuba is gearing up for a record year in tourism, there is an argument that says the island\\\'s economy might benefit from having a hotel man in the White House. He could well put the politics aside in favour of the economy, says Mr Azugaray.\"After all, the business of the United States is business!\" he laughs.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37059700','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-15 07:49:06',1),(30,'Milestones to 90','A look back at milestones in the very different lives of Queen Elizabeth and former Cuban leader Fidel Castro, who have both turned 90 this year.',' Two famous leaders have celebrated their 90th birthday this year: Queen Elizabeth and Fidel Castro, the former Cuban president. Here are some milestones in the parallel lives of two of the world\\\'s most recognisable figures.Mr Castro was born on 13 August to a wealthy sugar farmer from Spain who had settled in the Cuban town of Biran.Official and unofficial Castro biographers alike tend to agree that it was witnessing first-hand the exploitation of Haitian sugarcane workers on the farms that first influenced the young Fidel\\\'s fledging worldview.The Queen was born in London slightly earlier, on 21 April, as the first child of Albert, Duke of York, and his wife, formerly Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon. After her birth she was introduced to her future subjects on the balcony of Buckingham Palace, alongside the reigning monarchs, King George V and Queen Mary. Growing up, Fidel was sent to attend a Jesuit school. Under the influence of a priest called Father Llorente, he excelled in certain areas, including sports and outdoor expeditions.The young Elizabeth and her sister were educated at home. In 1937, Elizabeth\\\'s father was crowned King George VI. Fidel was awarded a prize for discipline in 1944 after finishing his course at school. He then went to Havana University to study law.It was as he entered the febrile, often violent world of student politics in 1940s Havana that he came of political age.In a speech he delivered in late 1947 he railed against \"the country\\\'s wealth in foreign hands\" and urged his fellow students to militancy, saying, \"A young nation can never say \\\'we surrender\\\'.\"Meanwhile, Elizabeth helped boost the nation\\\'s morale in the throes of World War II, visiting scouts and troops. In November 1947 she married her third cousin, Prince Philip of Greece, at Westminster Abbey. Their first child, Charles, was born in 1948. In 1952 Fidel started a revolution with his brother Raul. They were outnumbered, defeated, and imprisoned. Almost two years later they were pardoned and exiled to Mexico. There they met revolutionary \"Che\" Guevara.In 1956 the Castro brothers and Guevara returned to Cuba to launch a revolution. They succeeded in overthrowing President Fulgencio Batista in 1959.Elizabeth also came to power in the 1950s, after her father\\\'s death in 1952. She was crowned during an elaborate coronation ceremony at Westminster Abbey in June.Prime Minister Castro\\\'s new grip on power brought new friends and enemies. A US-led attempt to topple him in 1961, known as the \"Bay of Pigs Invasion\", was a disaster. Thousands of Americans were held hostage and Cuba began to form stronger ties with the Soviet Union. The Queen welcomed two new prime ministers to power in the 1960s and gave birth to her third child, Andrew, the first to be born to a reigning monarch in 103 years. The Cuban leader, who officially became president in 1976, continued to upset Western powers by supporting communist movements in Angola, Ethiopia and Yemen. The British monarch celebrated 25 years on the throne and welcomed the country\\\'s first female Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher. In 1979, amid the conflict in Northern Ireland, her cousin Lord Louis Mountbatten was killed by an IRA bomb on his boat.After economic hardship in the country, thousands of Cubans tried to gain asylum at embassies within the country. Frustrated, President Castro opened ports in the north of the country to allow anyone to leave and seek asylum. The year 1986 saw the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh make a state visit to China.No British monarch had ever travelled to mainland China, let alone walked the Great Wall, so the trip in October made history.The collapse of the Soviet Union threw the Cuban economy into chaos. Cuba lost around $6bn in annual subsidy from the Soviet Union and could no longer export sugar in exchange for its oil.  Cuba\\\'s factories and agriculture were paralysed.In 1988, President Castro met Pope John Paul II who called for reform on the island. It was the first time a papal visit had been paid to the country.A fire broke out at a royal residence, Windsor Castle, in 1992, threatening a large collection of art. In 1997, Princess Diana, former wife of the Queen\\\'s son Prince Charles, died in a car crash. The Royal Family grieved in private. However, the public reaction to Diana\\\'s death led to accusations that the Queen was out of touch with the public mood. The swell of anger shocked the Queen.President Castro was forced to step down from power in 2006 due to his poor health. His brother Raul took over. Prince Charles married again in 2005, to Camilla Parker-Bowles. Queen Elizabeth attended their religious blessing but was not present at their civil ceremony. The monarch told guests in a speech at the wedding reception that her son was \"home and dry with the woman he loves\".Both leaders celebrated their 90th birthdays. Fidel\\\'s was marked by low-key celebrations in Havana and a 90m-long cigar created in his honour by Cuban cigar roller Jose \"Cueto\" Castelar.Thousands of people marked Queen Elizabeth\\\'s 90th birthday with elaborate parades and dancing across the UK.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37071910','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-14 03:55:18',1),(31,'Record university offers now 3% higher than last year','A record 442,900 people have been offered places at UK universities since A-level results were published on Thursday.','The number of people offered places at UK universities has now hit a record 442,900 - 3% up on 2015, official figures show.

So far, over 14,000 have been accepted through clearing - 52% up on last year.Association of Colleges Chief Executive Martin Doel urged people to take time to choose the right course for them.A decline in the number of 18-year-olds and the removal of the cap which limits university places in England have contributed to \"a buyer\\\'s market\" in university applications. Ucas says clearing, the system which matches unfilled places with would-be-undergraduates without offers, opened two hours earlier than usual on results day with more places on offer.And some leading Bristol University said places were being filled very quickly, adding that the newly competitive environment meant that \"like all universities, we make use of clearing in ways that we wouldn\\\'t have a few years ago\". Birmingham University, which filled all its places on Thursday, said it had been \"inundated\" - with more than 6,000 calls for the small number of places available. Ucas says high numbers are likely to be accepted through clearing over the weekend - with the majority of applicants using this route expected to find places by the end of Monday. More than 153,000 people are still eligible to apply through clearing, says Ucas. Mr Doel said young people should also consider \"more affordable education and training routes available that can lead directly to a career\" including higher level technical and professional courses and apprenticeships at further education colleges. \"Not only are tuition fees less at a college, living and travelling costs are also much lower because it\\\'s possible to stay at home,\" said Mr Doel.

Mr Trobe also said changes to the AS-level - which do not now count towards the final A-level grade - had also effectively narrowed pupils\\\' choices.In the past, pupils had generally been allowed to take four subjects and then drop one at the end of the first year, he said.Now, he argued, \"we are just reducing curriculum choice, full stop.\"National Association of Head Teachers general secretary, Russell Hobby, said that while it was \"good to see an increase in the top grades awarded in modern foreign language\", a national strategy needed to be implemented to address the drop in entries.He said: \"Yet again we see a decrease in the number of students taking these subjects.\" \"We need to ensure that there are enough trained teachers to offer a breadth of languages, and for schools to be supported to ensure primary pupils are also exposed to the challenges of learning a language,\" he added.Schools minister Nick Gibb acknowledged that the drop-off in foreign languages was a \"worry\".\"There has been a slight decline in modern foreign languages but the introduction of the EBacc has arrested the historic fall of foreign languages at GCSE and we expect this will grow the pool of young people who are equipped to go on to study languages at A level.\"The Department for Education said it was protecting funding for 16- to 19-year-olds and ended the unfair difference between post-16 schools and colleges.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37117965','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-18 23:53:00',1),(35,'Degrees have \'retained earnings value\'','The value of a university degree in higher earnings has not been eroded by the increase in student numbers, says the Institute for Fiscal Studies.','The ability of a university degree to pave the way for higher earnings has not been eroded by the increase in student numbers, say researchers.The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has compared the advantages in incomes of UK graduates from the mid-1980s with those from the mid-1990s.Despite student numbers more than doubling in that time, the wage premium for graduates remained unchanged.Researchers also found that the number of graduate jobs had expanded.But they warn that the rising numbers of graduates could diminish their higher level of earnings in the future.The research also found that the biggest factor reducing the real value of earnings for all types of employees - graduates and non-graduates - had been the lack of wage increases since the recession.On Thursday, The IFS, a leading financial think-tank, has examined whether increasing numbers of university students have caused a decrease in the value of a degree.The study compared two cohorts of graduates, born about a decade apart, and found that graduate earnings showed no sign of being diminished by the growth in student numbers.\"The fact that the dramatic increase in the number of graduates in the early 1990s did not have any discernible negative impact on graduates\\\' wages relative to school-leavers is remarkable,\" said researcher Wenchao Jin.The study examined the typical earnings of graduates born between 1965 and 1969, who were students in the 1980s when only 14% of that age group went into higher education.Their earnings were compared with graduates born a decade later, who would have been students in the 1990s, and of whom 31% went to university.Researchers found that despite the big increase in those obtaining a degree, the relative average earnings difference between graduates and those who left school after GCSEs did not shrink.This durability of graduate earnings reflected changes in the economy.

The injection - known as the Men ACWY vaccine -  was first introduced for new university students in the UK last year. It protects against the A, C, Y and W strains of the disease - all forms that can cause death or disability. But health experts say they are particularly concerned about \"a highly aggressive strain\" of meningitis W bacteria.Some 22 people got meningitis W in 2009 in England, compared with almost 200 people in the last 12 months.Meningitis W infection is fatal in one in 10 cases and can lead to long-term health problems including deafness, epilepsy and amputations. Amy Davis, 24, from Surrey, got meningitis W when she was 18 years old, a few months before she was due to start college.  She said: \"At first I thought I had the flu and felt very tired. But by the next day, I was covered in a rash, felt extremely unwell  and was rushed to hospital. \"I spent three weeks in intensive care on life-support. My organs failed, and my family was told I was the most unwell person in the hospital.\" The infection spread to her bloodstream and bones and damaged her feet. She had toes on both feet amputated, and later her left leg was also amputated.She added: \"The jab was not available when I was 18. I would encourage everyone to get the vaccine who can.\"It takes just five minutes, and is just one injection that can save your life or save you from getting horrific side-effects.\"GPs in England are inviting 17 and 18-year-olds to come for a vaccine. First-time students under the age of 25 are eligible too.People who missed out on the jab last year should also see their doctor, experts say. And though students are the focus of the campaign, other young people are strongly advised to get the jab - whether they are planning on attending university or college or not. Dr Mary Ramsay, at Public Health England, said students needed to remain vigilant to signs of the disease.She added: \"Protecting young people from this potentially deadly disease as they embark upon one of the most important periods of their lives is vitally important. \"The vaccination will save lives and prevent lifelong devastating disability.\"Vinny Smith, of the Meningitis Research Foundation, said: \"By getting this free meningitis vaccine students are not only protecting themselves from a potentially deadly disease, but also protecting others by stopping the spread.\"It is also vital to watch out for friends if they are unwell. If they have meningitis it can be like a very bad hangover that quickly gets worse. It can be deadly so it is important to act fast and get medical help.\"Meanwhile Liz Brown, at the charity Meningitis Now, said people must not get complacent about the threat of meningitis. She added: \"Up to a quarter of students carry the bacteria that can cause meningitis compared to one in 10 of the general population. \"In the UK, every university could experience at least one case of meningitis amongst its students within the first term.\"Since 2015 the vaccine has also been rolled out for younger teenagers at schools across the UK.The ultimate aim is to ensure teenagers are offered the vaccine before they leave school.

The paper, to be presented to a Royal Geographical Society international conference later this month, maps the number of pupils sent to Oxford and Cambridge by different types of school from different regions. It has long been known that students from schools in London and the South East are disproportionately overrepresented at both Oxford and Cambridge, says the study. Using Department for Education data, it identifies the extent that access to England\\\'s two top universities varies between regions. Overall, considering both state and private schools together: But other regions of England are underrepresented: When the figures were broken down further, according to school type, the study found state schools in the South East sent 1.43 times more students than the national average to Oxford and Cambridge,In outer London, the figure is 1.24 times as many.But private schools in regions including Yorkshire and Humber, the East Midlands and the North East sent about half as many as the national average, the study - which has not yet been published online - found. Some Oxbridge \"feeder schools\" send up to 30% of their intake to the two universities, say the researchers.\"These are still largely the elite of the private sector, but this list also includes what have basically become elite sixth-form colleges,\" said Mr Gamsu. Mr Gamsu said London gentrification and selective sixth forms had contributed to the rise of \"super-state\" schools. \"The capital\\\'s rapid economic and social change lies behind the rise of these schools,\" he said.\"London\\\'s housing market has resulted in the price of accessing sought-after comprehensives in gentrified neighbourhoods rising beyond the means of many less affluent residents.\"Mr Gamsu cited north London\\\'s Camden School for Girls and Fortismere School, in Muswell Hill, as examples.A report earlier this year by London Councils said that last year 64,953 young Londoners had progressed to higher education, up 4% on the previous year.  \"While this is good news, more still needs to be done to ensure everyone can make the journey from school or college to higher education,\" that report added.The Department for Education pointed out that, in a bid to widen access, the \"There should be no barrier to any child\\\'s ambitions and we are already seeing record numbers of disadvantaged young people going to university. \"We want to go further and ensure we are building a society that works for everyone,\" said a spokeswoman.

But many children with special educational needs or disabilities are now no longer eligible for government funding or support, according to 43% of those polled.  The union says new criteria mean that while pupils with complex or severe needs are eligible for high needs funding support, those with less complex needs such as dyslexia or dyspraxia do not automatically receive support. As many as 200,000 previously identified as having special needs were not transferred into the new system, says the union. Too many children \"are slipping through the net completely,\" one primary teacher told the researchers. \"It\\\'s frustrating and heartbreaking,\" said another.And a staff member at a secondary school said lack of funding meant they had halved the amount of support for children recognised as needing special support next year. The 2014 changes were \"an ambitious and well intentioned reform\", said Dr Bousted. But \"unless the government provides significant and immediate additional funding the worrying situation we see now is likely to deteriorate further\", she added. The Department for Education said the \"biggest changes to special needs provision in a generation\" meant it had \"increased high needs funding by over \\xc2\\xa390m this year and given councils \\xc2\\xa335.8m to help implement our changes effectively as well as improving support for families\". \"Ensuring teachers are trained to have an understanding of the needs of pupils with special educational needs and disabilities is a key part of our drive to give all children access to the education they deserve,\" added a spokeswoman, who said this training would in future be a key part of initial teacher training.

The American University of Nigeria (AUN) was established in this unlikely spot, founded by the former Nigerian Vice-President Atiku Abubakar, who was orphaned in this area as a young boy. \"Be a development university,\" he said when the university was established a little over a decade ago. Four years ago, with a growing number of unemployed youth just outside the gates of the university, and the hungry and hopeless in flight from Boko Haram flooding into our small city, the American University of Nigeria (AUN) began to implement our vision of a \"development university.\"  We reached out to local religious and community leaders to see how we might partner with them in peace, food security, and education programmes.More stories from the The AUN-Adamawa Peace Initiative (AUN-API) was born. All major local Muslim and Christian leaders, traditional rulers, and local community leaders actively participate. Our goals are simple: educate and feed as many people as we can.  In the process, we were guided by a number of principles - make sure women and girls are included in all projects; join with religious leaders in all efforts; involve AUN students, faculty and staff in all of these efforts; and make sure our local vulnerable youth know that they have a network of people who care about them.The tsunami of hungry frightened people began arriving in Yola in 2014. The first 5,000 had few relatives in the area, no food and no access to school. The next wave of 20,000 arrived by foot and by bus. Their hungry faces were seen everywhere in town. The Catholic cathedral and Muslim Centre became the major feeding areas.Our peace initiative members developed comprehensive lists of where people came from, their names, ages, and gender so we could provide the most accurate food and supplies. For example, women needed sanitary supplies; some young children needed life saving oral rehydration. At the university, we held classes all day and raised funds and fed hungry people the rest of the time.By early 2016, the university\\\'s peace initiative had fed close to 300,000 people. One young woman and baby, who had been held in the Sambisa forest by Boko Haram and were severely malnourished, died in our local hospital. We all mourned.What have we learned here that can be applied to other cities and countries?  First is the centrality of local leaders in any development effort. These conscientious and concerned religious and community leaders know which youth are particularly at risk to be radicalised.  Second, find out what these young people really want. Our peace network identifies the youth who need literacy education, tools to start a business, training to learn about information technology (which our youth want as much as any around the world). Then the university designs programmes and projects to meet these needs. The young people told us they wanted to play sports. Thousands have joined our Peace Through Sports programme, which not only gives young people a chance to compete with each other in soccer, basketball and volleyball, and something to do during the day, but also teaches them to think about peace and cooperation. We begin each programme with a discussion of peace, led by members of the peace initiative. We listen to them talk about their challenges. Most of the games occur on our campus, where students and staff welcome them and make them feel they are part of our community. Every team is made up of members of different religious and tribal communities. They forge teams with people they would otherwise never encounter, much less befriend.While it\\\'s impossible to pinpoint which of our programmes have kept youth from joining the terrorist group in our back yard, more than one young man has said to me: \"It is either you or Boko Haram - there is nothing else.\" Peace initiative leaders can document that none of the youth they identified and brought into our various programmes joined the terrorist group.As the threat from Boko Haram fades, the problems local people face have not diminished. Thousands of very young children have been orphaned, left in our city to live with non-family members. Hunger has increased, as thousands of farmers were not able to plant their crops. The university is trying to deal with this next phase of the humanitarian crisis. The US Agency for International Development (USAID) and university founder Atiku Abubakar provided seed, which we distributed.With assistance from USAID, we established Technology Enhanced Literacy for All, which employs tablet computers and radio broadcasts to extend learning to 22,000 out-of-school children.  Many of the students walk up to three miles each way to participate. If for some reason a session is cancelled, children are visibly upset. When a radio failed to materialise recently, children went house-to-house in a village until they found someone willing to lend them one. The university feeds and provides literacy and numeracy education to hundreds of children who are homeless, orphans, and Almajiri (Muslim religious school) boys. The programme, Feed and Read, has just expanded to include Feed and Read for Girls. These children are out of school and are among the millions of Nigerian children who comprise the largest out-of-school population in the world. Currently, about 500 children receive instruction and a meal through these two programmes. The plan is to expand to help 2,000 children by 2017.The demand for our projects far exceeds the number of places and available funding. At every session, hundreds of children crowd around the learning centres in hope of participating. The children in the Feed and Read programmes share their meal with children who are not. It\\\'s heartbreaking to know that we can\\\'t help so many children who are hungry for learning, and just plain hungry.It is essential that these modest efforts be replicated and expanded immediately. Otherwise, the most vicious cycle will begin again, devouring youth who are uneducated, destitute, with no family, no support, and nothing else in their lives. We all know where that leads.  The debate in the West about terrorism is usually presented in stark and defensive terms: increase security, curtail civil liberties and reduce the number of refugees allowed to emigrate.

The United Nations says there are now 2.8 million people in the area surrounding Lake Chad who have been forced out of their homes by the violence of the Boko Haram terror group.\"Chad is trying to build its education system and has seen a huge influx of people - and they\\\'re trying to bring children into their school system.\"It\\\'s an enormous act of generosity if you think about it.

It is unclear if he was making a pun.The university intends to admit students again in 2017. But with further cuts expected, and the government encouraging universities to prioritise courses with large numbers of students, Eskimology faces an uncertain future.Yet Eskimologists are refusing to go down without a fight. The subject might bring to mind igloos, ice fishing, the North Pole and Pingu.But they say studying the Arctic has never been more relevant, because of the region\\\'s rapidly melting ice sheets and increasing interest by governments and extraction companies in mining its natural resources.The subject was introduced at the University of Copenhagen in 1920 to teach students about the language, history and culture of communities in the Arctic.These communities are now called Inuit rather than Eskimo, but the academic discipline has remained as Eskimology.Social and political issues affecting Greenland, such as mining and climate change, are a big part of Copenhagen\\\'s undergraduate and master\\\'s courses in the subject.The focus is on Greenland because of Denmark\\\'s colonial history in the country. Students come not just from Denmark and Greenland, but the UK, France, Poland and north America.Eskimology\\\'s student intake was suspended after the government\\\'s January budget asked the university to find savings of \\xc2\\xa352m.This led to more than 500 job losses and a new focus on subjects that cater for a large number of students. A number of smaller subjects were frozen or abolished entirely.Universities in Denmark are funded by the government and free to Danish students, but the cuts could force them to rethink their purpose.Should they focus on teaching more vocational subjects that are in demand by employers, or should they continue to pursue knowledge for its own sake?Yet an Eskimologist at Copenhagen says the subject has never been more relevant.Greenland\\\'s melting sea ice sheets, calls for its independence from Denmark, and the international interest in its mineral, oil and gas resources have led to governments and extraction companies coming to Copenhagen\\\'s Eskimologists for briefings.Frank Sejersen, one of three Eskimology professors at Copenhagen, is studying how Greenlanders should respond to the advances of large international mining firms wanting to extract its resources.More stories from the Greenland achieved a degree of self-governance from Denmark in 2009, including extraction rights over its vast mineral and oil resources. Since then, Greenland has been besieged by offers from companies in Russia, Canada and Norway.Many Greenlanders want to accept these lucrative offers, but Prof Sejersen\\\'s research urges them to be cautious.\"Our research group has found that Greenland would need a huge number of mines to meet their expectations of more economic independence from Denmark, and even then the money raised should not be spent but invested for the long-term to avoid overheating the economy,\" he argues.\"We are also studying how to make sure unskilled Greenlanders also benefit from the growth of the mining industry, and what effect this industry might have on social equality in the country.\"Eskimologists at Copenhagen have received more requests than ever from foreign embassies and companies interested in the Arctic.\"They want to understand the politics of the region, whether Greenland will become independent from Denmark and what effect this might have, and how climate change will affect the dynamics of the region,\" says Prof Sejersen.\"We give these briefings for free - it is part of our role as a government-funded university.\"The cuts we are facing in the coming years are extremely high and we don\\\'t know how they will hit or where or when.\" But he insists that with \"so many things happening in the Arctic\", Eskimology can be \"at the forefront of Arctic research\".Tine Pars, the rector of Greenland\\\'s only university, says the existence of Eskimology at Copenhagen has improved relations between the two countries at a time when Greenland is considering becoming independent from Denmark.\"We have had a lot of collaboration with Eskimology and Arctic Studies at Copenhagen University over the years,\" she says. \"These academic collaborations have been good for research and teaching, and good for both countries.\"Copenhagen is the only university in the world where Greenlandic, the national language of Greenland, is taught as a foreign language. This means Greenlanders who only speak Danish often come to Copenhagen\\\'s Eskimologists to learn the language of their country at university level.When the government cuts were announced in January, media and politicians in Denmark and Greenland called for Eskimology to be saved.Prof Sejersen says his department\\\'s study of the relationship between Denmark and Greenland may even benefit other countries with their own independence debates.\"Greenland\\\'s transition from colonial governance to self-determination has been made in a friendly and productive way, and foreign embassies have come to us for advice about how they can replicate this in their own country,\" he says.The arrangement means that Denmark is a member of the EU but Greenland is not.If another referendum on Scottish independence is called in the next few years, perhaps Theresa May will ask an Eskimologist for advice.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36905556','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-03 07:08:05',1),(54,'Social division stays in online learning','There are strong social divisions in how young people use digital technology at home, according to international research from the OECD.','There are strong social divisions in how young people use digital technology, according to international research from the OECD.The economics think tank found that in many countries wealthy and poor pupils spent similar amounts of time online.But richer youngsters were much more likely to use the internet for learning rather than games.The study argues that even with equal access to technology a \"digital divide\" persists in how the internet is used.The OECD report, based on data from more than 40 countries mostly in Europe, Asia and South America, looked at how teenagers used online technology at home.Access to the internet and digital technology are seen as important to educational achievement.But this study shows significant differences in how teenagers spend their time online - and suggests that new technology does not stop old social divisions.It also suggests that encouraging strong reading skills is the key to making the most of the internet.The researchers found online activity was directly linked to \"socio-economic status\", with wealthier students more likely to use the internet for educationally advantageous activities such as gathering information and reading news.Poorer students were more likely to use the internet for games or chatting online.The information was gathered as part of the international Pisa tests and it shows how teenagers might be using the internet to help their studies.The research suggests that inequality emerges, even in countries with near-universal internet access.\"Equal access does not imply equal opportunities,\" says the report, and a lack of familiarity with using the internet for information will have a negative impact in areas such as studying or looking for jobs.More stories from the This happens within countries, but the study also reveals big differences between countries - with teenagers in wealthier northern European countries more likely to use the internet for getting information, rather than playing or socialising.Finland and Iceland have the highest levels of teenagers using the internet for information, followed by Estonia, Norway and Slovenia.There were also higher-than-average educational uses of the internet in Denmark, Hong Kong, Poland, Germany and Singapore.In Mexico, Jordan and Turkey young people were much more likely to go online to play games and much less for news or information.Those spending the longest time online were also from Nordic countries, Denmark, Sweden and Norway. And in a number of more affluent European countries, including Belgium, Finland, Denmark and Germany, poorer families spent longer online than wealthy ones.The UK did not take part in the section of the survey comparing types of computer use, but it did provide data for overall internet access.This showed very high levels of online access in the UK for both rich and poor.It was among a group of countries including the Nordic nations, the Netherlands, Switzerland and Hong Kong, where the wealthiest and poorest quarter of the young population almost all had the internet at home.This was in contrast to countries such as Vietnam, Indonesia, Mexico and Peru where poorer families were much less likely to have internet access.In such countries, the report says school plays a much more important role in ensuring that young people have access to information and communications equipment.The report says that there have been efforts to narrow such gaps in access, but a more valuable response might be to focus on making sure that all young people have strong literacy skills.\"Ensuring that every child attains a baseline level of proficiency in reading will do more to create equal opportunities in a digital world than will expanding or subsidising access to high-tech devices and services.\"But the findings were criticised as \"simplistic\" by Mark Chambers, chief executive of Naace, the UK body supporting the use of computers in schools.He rejected the idea that it should be a choice between either improving reading or focusing on digital skills, as both were mutually beneficial.Mr Chambers said it was no surprise that the wealthy would have the most confidence and take the most advantage of new technology.And he questioned whether internet access at home was really the same for rich and poor, suggesting that it did not mean that all young people had equal access to broadband and their own computer.\"In the UK, homes of students from a low economic, social and cultural background often don\\\'t have landline phones and internet access through them, relying instead on mobiles,\" he said.Schools should work to reduce social divisions, he said, rather than \"retrenching to Victorian approaches\".','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-36835585','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-07-27 19:06:07',1),(55,'Girls on top','With girls\' dominance on the university campus set to continue, we ask why more women than men go to university.','It is the cliched newspaper picture of exam success - three girls smiling incredulously or jumping for joy at how well they have done.But like all good cliches, there is more than a grain of truth in these typical snapshots of A-level results day.Girls do better than boys at A-levels (or Highers in Scotland), and indeed at every level of education. So, with A-level grades the main qualifications for university, it is hardly surprising that women are now far more likely than men to go there.This year nearly 80% of girls\\\' entries were graded A* to C, compared with 75% of boys.And according to this year\\\'s university application figures, the difference in application rates between men and women across the UK is the widest on record.In England, young women are 36% more likely to apply than young men. The gender gap in applications is also at its greatest ever in Scotland and Wales, while in Northern Ireland there is the largest gap since 2009.Mary Curnock Cook, chief executive of the University and College Admissions Service, is so concerned for the future of boys that she wants to see a concerted national effort to tackle the issue.If current trends continue, she says, within a decade the gap between rich and poor at university entrance will be \"eclipsed by the gap between males and females\".Furthermore, she predicts: \"If this differential growth carries on unchecked, then girls born this year will be 75% more likely to go to university than their male peers.\"So what is at the root of this gap? Are girls simply academically better these days, and boys less ambitious? Or is something more complicated happening?By the time teenagers get to sixth form, girls are already significantly outnumbering boys, let alone outperforming them.  That is a result of their better results at GCSEs.Some 55% of pupils taking A-level standard qualifications were female in 2015, compared to 45% of boys. So before they sit a single exam, there are potentially more girls than boys who are likely to go to university.Once the exams are done and dusted, they tend to get better results. The average A-level grade for a girl is C+ compared to C for a boy.But the differences between boys and girls start much earlier on. According to a University of Bristol study, boys are nearly twice as likely as girls to have fallen behind by the time they start school.The research found 80,000 boys in England started in a reception class struggling to speak a full sentence or follow instructions and, worryingly, many of these children will never catch up.Add to this the fact that primary schools tend to be dominated by female teachers, and mothers helping out, and the jigsaw of male underachievement does not look quite so puzzling.According to research into boys\\\' underachievement for the Higher Education Policy Institute, girls and boys often have different cultural attitudes towards school work.The report by its director Nick Hillman, quoting OECD research, says: \"Boys are eight percentage points more likely than girls to regard school as a waste of time.\"And across OECD countries boys tend to spend over one hour less per week on homework than girls, he adds.Boys are more likely to play computer games and less likely to read outside of school, he says in his paper.This sense that boys are not so keen to apply themselves academically is backed up by the former head teacher of Sydney Russell School in Dagenham, Roger Leighton.\"There is a touch of boys having a greater tendency to think they can get away with minimum work and wanting to spend their time doing other \\\'more interesting things\\\',\" he says.\"Girls, on the other hand, tend to understand the need to knuckle down earlier on - they take a longer view.\"There are some other changes in the nature of universities which have led to the dominance of women on campus.The conversion of the old polytechnics to universities in the 1990s brought a huge swathe of female students into the university fold. And as Mr Hillman remarks: \"Skilled careers traditionally chosen by women, such as nursing and teaching, did not demand full degrees in the past.\" \"When this changed, the number of women in higher education increased dramatically,\" he adds. Once subjects linked to medicine and education are discounted, the disparity in the total number of male and female higher education students drops from around 281,000 to just 34,000.However, men are not completely on the back foot in higher education. They are still outperforming women in some of the most prestigious areas - such as entry to the toughest universities and toughest courses.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37107208','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-08-18 17:40:22',1),(56,'Free lunch?','As thousands of students prepare to head off to university for the first time, here are 10 alternative ways they can help fund their education.','The results are in and you\\\'ve got a place at university.

But for those with more modest abilities, there are now thousands of schools across the country offering courses in entrepreneurship. The days seem long gone when students sought skills that would secure them a job for life working for somebody else.\"There\\\'s been a massive shift,\" says Derrick Maggard, director of the Apex Systems Center for Innovation and Entrepreneurship at Virginia Tech.\"Most of these students grew up during the great recession and saw their parents, maybe their grandparents or an aunt or uncle struggle and get laid off by large companies. \"They\\\'re almost fearful to go into the corporate world,\" Maggard said. \"They say, I don\\\'t want that to happen to me - I want to do my own thing and control my destiny.\"He says the most important characteristics for a successful entrepreneur are the ability to handle ambiguity and the skills to bring an idea to fruition.\"Ideas are a dime a dozen and there is nothing in the world that somebody hasn\\\'t already thought of. It really comes down to the ability to execute an idea and that is a really difficult process,\" he says. Mark Zuckerberg is now worth more than $52bn (\\xc2\\xa339bn), adding $18bn to his fortune in the last year alone according to Forbes. And while he represents a tiny percentage of entrepreneurs, many other successful companies have been started in a college dorm room.Dyn was co-founded in 2001 by Jeremy Hitchcock, studying at Worcester Polytechnic Institute, Massachusetts. He developed a way to optimise the flow of data between online companies and their users to improve internet performance. Dyn, based in Manchester, New Hampshire, now employs 400 people and boasts clients such as Twitter and Etsy. \"I\\\'d give the same advice to any university student,\" says Hitchcock. \"Go start a company or be part of something where you\\\'re creating or building, because you\\\'re at a time in life when you have that freedom of exploration. And do something that\\\'s crazy, that\\\'s non-traditional.\"Maggard says there is no better place for experimentation than a college campus where students can also develop professional networks. \"If you are a student entrepreneur and you have an idea with a time limit on getting it to market, I would encourage you to take a leave of absence and give it a go. But those are rare,\" he says.\"Work on it while you\\\'re in school. Develop the idea and continue to do customer research.

She was also able to meet a potential investor who focuses on backing women-owned companies.\"Female entrepreneurs are on the rise,\" says Maggard. \"But one challenge they do face is equal access to capital. Venture capitalists are known to invest less in female led start-ups.\"\"Research shows that women are more risk averse than men, and this can be paraded around as unfavourable,\" says Kathy Korman Frey, entrepreneur in residence at George Washington University and founder of But, she says, attitudes towards women entrepreneurs are changing.\"If I know my investment is safer with a person who is going to consider all the options and then make a move, that\\\'s a (good) investment strategy.\"She says millennials - particularly women - also have a different definition of success and are better at identifying work-life balance.\"They are much more sophisticated in looking beyond their current state and saying, this is the way I\\\'d like my life and my work to be.

But how are they different from the old tests?The tests sat by primary school children this year are new because they are the first to test the new national primary curriculum. This covers different material from the old one and has been taught in schools only since 2014.Therefore a totally new set of tests has been developed to measure attainment in three subjects; maths, reading, and spelling, grammar and punctuation.Writing is evaluated separately by teacher assessment.The tests are taken in Year 2 and Year 6, but only the tests taken by 11-year-olds are marked externally.Department for Education officials are keen to stress that these new tests are not comparable to those taken in previous years.The new primary curriculum was drawn up to be deliberately tougher than the old one, and is described as a \"knowledge-based curriculum\".Therefore, the tests themselves are tougher than they have been in recent years.This was a conscious decision by ministers seeking to raise standards. They argued that the standards expected of pupils at the end of primary school had not been high enough.Previously, attainment at the end of Key Stage 2 was measured in Levels - Level 4c being the expected standard for pupils in their final year of primary school.In the new tests, the expected standard is measured completely differently. The expected level is set at 100, but scores can range between 80 and 120.Effectively, anything at 100 or over is a pass and anything under is a fail. This year, panels of teachers set the actual mark on individual test papers required to meet the expected standard. This is based on a series of key performance indicators within the national curriculum.No. DfE officials describe it as a \"year zero\".The tests are measuring pupils\\\' knowledge of a new curriculum - even if they have been studying it for only two years. And the standard is higher.However, it is understood the expected standard is broadly equivalent to a Level 4b.In the old system, this meant children working securely within Level 4 with its set of competencies.Last year, in maths 87% of pupils reached Level 4, compared with 77% of pupils reaching Level 4b.In reading, 89% reached Level 4 and 80% reached Level 4b.The DfE will release a set of figures representing the national average result. It will show the percentage of pupils nationally working at 100 in reading, maths and spelling and grammar. It will also give the percentage of pupils working at 100 in all three subjects.Bearing in mind the raising of the expected standards and the fact that pupils have been studying this new curriculum for only two years, a lower percentage of pupils are likely to reach the all-important 100 mark than reached the old Level 4.The fact that teachers and pupils were grappling with a completely new set of tests, with fewer practice papers, is likely to mean pupils will not do as well this year as in later years.There have also been complaints from teachers and heads that some of the questions on the papers were harder than expected.Ultimately, the results of the tests will be used to hold schools to account for the attainment of their pupils and the progress that they make.Progress is measured by the distance of travel between the tests taken at the end of Key Stage 1, sat by seven-year-olds, and the results of those taken at age 11.Head teachers have argued that this year\\\'s results should not be used to measure schools\\\' achievements because of the likely volatility in the system.Ministers have rejected that, and Education Secretary Nicky Morgan has said that only a maximum of 1% more schools than last year will be allowed to fall below the minimum standards they must meet before intervention happens.In 2016, a school will be above the floor if at least 65% of pupils meet the expected standard in reading, writing and mathematics or the school achieves sufficient progress scores in each of the \"three Rs\".','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-36682743','2016-08-20 09:57:42','2016-07-05 18:38:33',1),(59,'Donald Trump to black voters: \'What do you have to lose?\'','Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump makes a direct appeal to African-American voters, asking \"What do you have to lose?\"','Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has made a direct appeal to African-American voters, saying \"What do you have to lose?\"Mr Trump told a nearly all-white audience in Michigan that black voters \"are living in poverty\" and their \"schools are no good\".He promised to \"produce\" for African-Americans where Democrats had failed.\"If you keep voting for the same people, you will keep getting exactly the same result,\" he said.He said his opponent, Democrat Hillary Clinton, \"would rather provide a job to a refugee\" than to unemployed black youths, \"who have become refugees in their own country\".Mrs Clinton called Mr Trump\\\'s remarks \"so ignorant it\\\'s staggering\".Mr Trump also predicted he would receive 95% of the African-American vote if he went to on to run for a second term in 2020.President Barack Obama, historically the most popular president among African-Americans in US history, received 93% of the black vote in 2012.Mr Trump has suffered from dismal support among African-Americans.

In a statement, Apple Music said fans should \"keep an eye out this weekend for more from Frank\". The release is also expected to include a printed publication called Boys Don\\\'t Cry, distributed in Apple\\\'s retail stores.

The accompanying video in which (spoiler alert) the musician builds a spiral staircase resembles a live stream that first appeared When it failed to appear, Apple representatives told disappointed fans they were \"waiting for the artist\".There is no apparent reason for the repeated delays to Ocean\\\'s album. He claimed to have completed it last year and at least one of the tracks dates back 20 months. (At Your Best) You Are Love, a cover of the Isley Brothers\\\' classic, recorded at Abbey Road, was initially posted on Ocean\\\'s Tumblr blog in January 2015, marking the anniversary of Aaliyah\\\'s death.

Beyonce, of course, had to go one better - bundling her album with an Emmy-nominated HBO special.Why do artists prefer to do it this way? Two reasons: First, it reduces the risk of an album leaking, as it cuts out CD pressing plants, distributors, publicists and journalists - all of whom have been the source of leaks in the past.Secondly it virtually guarantees publicity, without the artist having to consent to interviews or tedious promotional tours. Even better, if the album isn\\\'t up to scratch, you get acres of press coverage before the critics pounce.But what does this mean for people outside the music industry bubble? How confusing must Frank Ocean\\\'s album release seem to the person who buys two CDs a year at Asda? Do they even know it exists? And, if they do, how do they listen to it?The music industry is increasingly enamoured with these surprise releases but it would never happen for a blockbuster movie, which requires months of carefully-planned placement and positioning.

He initially fled the capital, Juba, during violence in July. A UN spokesperson, Farhan Haq, said the UN had learned on Wednesday that Mr Machar was in DR Congo near the South Sudan border and decided to airlift him to Kinshasa.The UN official said Mr Machar needed to be airlifted to safety and that he had been given medical assistance.  Mr Machar demanded a neutral force be deployed in July to keep peace and guarantee his safety after his bodyguards and President Salva Kiir\\\'s presidential guards fought each other, sparking days of violence. Hundreds of people died and more than 100,000 fled across the border.The fighting erupted less than a year after a peace deal was signed to form a unity government and end the civil war.The UN has launched an independent investigation into allegations that its peacekeepers failed to respond when troops loyal to Mr Kiir attacked a residential compound popular with foreign aid workers last month.During the attack, a local journalist was shot dead at point-blank range and troops reportedly raped several women, among them foreigners working for relief agencies.Political differences between Mr Machar and Mr Kiir ignited the civil war in December 2013 - and they only agreed to settle their differences under intense international pressure, signing a peace deal last August.Mr Machar returned to Juba in April to take up the post of vice-president, but President Kiir dismissed him in the wake of the latest violence. He has not been seen in public since and his exact whereabouts are unknown.A member of his opposition SPLA-IO party told the BBC he was en route to Ethiopia, via the Democratic Republic of Congo, but earlier media reports said he was in Tanzania or Chad.

In Dakar - which has a population of more than a million people - it is a different story.Children have reported being beaten if they fail to earn the sums demanded by marabouts, which can range from between 350 CFA ($0.50, \\xc2\\xa3.049) and 500 CFA.At least five children living in residential Koranic schools died in the first half of 2016 allegedly as a result of beatings meted out by their teachers or in traffic accidents while being forced to beg, according to a Human Rights Watch (HRW) report published in July. Dozens of other children have been severely beaten, chained and sexually abused or violently attacked while begging over the last 18 months, the report said.Although arrests of abusive teachers have increased slightly over the past year, courts in Senegal have prosecuted only a handful of cases and prosecutions for forced child begging are almost never pursued, HRW says.Activists say leaders have been worried about the potential political fall-out of such arrests. \"Politicians don\\\'t want to upset influential Muslim leaders,\" says Moussa Ndoye, who is in charge of a community project aiming to reduce child begging.\"I have yet to see any strong actions to support the president\\\'s recent declarations.\"But authorities argue the \"removal\" operations which started in June have already had an impact.\"This is the first time the police have ever forcibly removed children from the streets to protect them,\" says child protection director Mr Diouf.\"Already there are visibly less children begging in the city\\\'s business centre. We know some marabouts are returning to their villages\".But Mr Ndoye believes these measures are insufficient.\"It makes no sense to just pull children off the streets, no thought has been put into this action, there is no plan,\" he says.\"The action must be clearly mapped out and funded and involve the entire community. The state and the marabouts must speak to each other.\"Mr Diouf does concede that policing the streets in search of children will not be enough to end the practice.He says the authorities are in the process of registering all of the Koranic schools so they can be properly regulated.At the state-run shelter for rounded up children, Ousseynou is provided with clean clothes, medical care and food. The children\\\'s guardians, either their parents or their marabout, will be summoned to pick them up. They will be issued with a warning: If the same child is found on the streets again, they will face prosecution.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37109567','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-08-18 21:38:03',1),(93,'Pumza Fihlani: No winners in baby kidnapping case','A South African woman is to be sentenced for kidnapping a child, Zephany Nurse, 19 years ago. But, as the BBC\'s Pumza Fihlani asks, is this the best outcome?','Imagine growing up in a family where you are the apple of your father\\\'s eye and the centre of your mother\\\'s world. You are happy and mostly carefree and looking forward to celebrating your 18th birthday. Now imagine finding out that the woman you have loved all your life had stolen you, and the man you called your dad is not your biological father.This is Zephany Nurse\\\'s reality. Zephany is the name her biological parents, Celeste and Morne Nurse, gave her shortly after she was born at Cape Town\\\'s Groote Schuur Hospital, South Africa, on 27 April 1997. The name she grew up with has not been publicised to protect her identity.A 51-year-old woman, whose name has not been revealed for the same reason, has been sentenced to 10 years in jail after she was found guilty in March of snatching Zephany from a hospital bed while Celeste was still recovering from giving birth. The trial has gripped many South Africans, with people sending messages of support to the young woman on social media. But how has Zephany coped in this highly publicised trial?Those close to the case say it has destroyed her sense of who she is. She has said she wants to stay with the woman who kidnapped her, rather than her biological parents.Zephany was found after one of the Nurse family\\\'s other daughters started going to the same secondary school as her and noticed a similarity.Celeste and Morne became suspicious, contacted police, and DNA tests later confirmed that she was indeed their biological daughter. The woman who had raised her was arrested and so began what has become one of South Africa\\\'s most intriguing, and heart-breaking, cases. So what drove the accused to such a desperate act?During the trial, South Africans learned how she had suffered a number of miscarriages, which she said had made her desperate to have a child of her own to love. But she denies stealing the baby. She said she was handed a new-born baby at a busy railway station by a woman called Sylvia, who cannot be found.\"No-one believes me at this moment and I\\\'m a victim myself. I was tricked into something I was not aware of,\" she told the BBC in an interview she gave before she was convicted. She also said that she had signed adoption papers, but they have been lost.Although her husband only found out about the child\\\'s true identify when the story came to light last year, he continues to support her.\"We would always thank her for being a wonderful mother,\" he is quoted by He has also spoken fondly of special holidays spent as a family. \"For 17 years, we [had] a tradition of [doing] breakfast-in-bed every Mother\\\'s Day my wife spent with Zephany. I would do the eggs, Zephany would do the toast, flowers and presents. She would also do the decorations,\" he is quoted as saying. Zephany is currently living with the man who helped raise her. He says she is distraught about \"losing her mother\".Cape Town-based clinical psychologist Oliver Fachs explains that someone in Zephany\\\'s situation would experience a deep sense of being \"unsettled\".He says being around the people who raised her therefore \"makes sense\". \"Her frame of meaning, sense of identity, how she locates herself in the world - all that would have been shattered,\" he told the BBC.\"What would concern me as a psychologist would be to monitor how she deals with this new reality.\"Mr Fuchs notes that psychology and the law are at odds.  While a crime was undoubtedly committed, Zephany was not aware of this until recently and spent almost her whole life forming an attachment to the people who raised her. She has not spoken directly to the media but in a \"Don\\\'t you think for once that that is my mother? Whether it is true or not is not for you to toy with,\" she said.She also spoke about the man who brought her up as her father in the statement: \"How would you feel as a father, desperately broken but still finds the goodness to support his family.\"During the course of the trial she was barred from seeing the accused woman and was reunited with her biological parents. But she is said to have struggled to make a connection with them.The Nurses\\\' love, however, is patient and has already been tested by time.For example, Celeste told the court how the family would mark Zephany\\\'s birthday every year. And so they are prepared to give her the time she needs and work hard to gain her trust and affection. But they do feel cheated out of a life with her and the ordeal has proven too much for the couple.  While testifying during the sentencing hearing, Morne told the court his marriage to Celeste had suffered and they struggled to repair relations. The pair divorced in February 2015. He broke down as he spoke of the many years they had spent searching for their daughter. \"I don\\\'t know how she kept Zephany hidden for so long. We always looked for her. It\\\'s unbelievable how the accused kept hiding my child,\" he said. \"I don\\\'t have a relationship with my daughter and it hurts,\" he told the court. He pleaded with the accused to stop the deceit. Giving his verdict, Judge John Hlophe described the defendant\\\'s account as a fairy tale and said the \"court rejects it with the contempt it deserves\".But the accused insists that all she is guilty of is loving a child no-one wanted. Now that the sentence has been handed down, there will be the question of how justice is best served. Zephany has lost the person she sees as her mother, a husband has lost his wife to prison and daughter, the Nurse family, who have already lost years with their daughter, still do not have her. There are no winners here.

Many homes were set on fire and reduced to piles of bricks. Some of the villagers are still recovering from their injuries: I saw one man hobbling along on crutches as a result of a gunshot wound.The attack in Agatu was one of the most serious in These types of clashes between herdsmen and farmers are increasingly common in some parts of the country as the struggle over grazing rights and access to water becomes more acute.The violence is largely blamed on Fulani herdsmen, a semi-nomadic group who roam areas in West and Central Africa.During the dry season in Nigeria, herdsmen begin the long migration from the northern states to the country\\\'s central region in search of grazing pastures for their cattle.It is a journey the herdsmen, often young boys, have been making for centuries. Following well-established routes, they often return to the same areas. But land that was once unclaimed and, therefore, free to graze on is now being farmed, frequently triggering clashes. Hundreds of people have been killed in the violence in 2016.Farmers accuse the Fulani of failing to control their cattle and of damaging crops. In turn, the Fulani accuse farmers of stealing their cattle. The Fulani insist they are only trying to defend themselves and preserve their traditional way of life.\"In the past you graze anywhere, you didn\\\'t come into contact with farms. But now you\\\'re forced to herd cattle along the road,\" says Isa Mosham Sarkin, a local Fulani leader in neighbouring Nasarawa state. \"People are saying that Fulani are a threat to the nation. But we\\\'re not the ones causing the problems - it is some farmers.\"Some observers fear that unless the issues are addressed the clashes could become more violent.Growing insecurity and the effects of climate change are making a bad situation even worse, says Israel Okpe, from Pastoral Resolve, an organisation that promotes conflict resolution between farmers and the Fulani.\"Both sides are becoming more armed, they are preparing for anything,\" says Mr Okpe. \"We don\\\'t know where the weapons are coming from but they are sophisticated.\"The violence is also playing into the country\\\'s politics, which frequently breaks down along ethnic lines.President Muhammadu Buhari, a Fulani, has been accused of turning a blind eye to the problem, sparking a public outcry.In response, the government ordered security forces to crack down on cattle rustlers. The government is also discussing plans to station security guards on farms and open up special cattle ranches where the herdsmen\\\'s cattle would be allowed to graze.But critics say that will mean forcing farmers to give up land they already control, sparking further resistance.For rice farmer, Rotimi Williams, there is only one solution: Farmers and the Fulani will need to find a way to share the land.When 20 hectares (49 acres) of his rice paddies were ruined in February, he admits he was furious.Some of his labourers were ready to take up arms. But he decided on a different approach.Instead of lashing out, he hired the Fulani herdsman who caused the damage to provide security.  He then employed dozens of women from the nearby Fulani village to work in the fields.\"We need a pragmatic approach where we learn to resolve conflicts with our neighbours,\" he says.\"The situation is spinning out of control.

The BBC\'s Enoh N\'Dri asks whether it will work.','It may not be as prestigious as champagne, but Ivory Coast wants to get a protected status for attieke, the national food. The BBC\\\'s Enoh N\\\'Dri asks whether it will work. Attieke (pronounced atchekay) is a traditional couscous made from ground cassava roots eaten by many Ivorians of all ages for breakfast, lunch and dinner. It originated from the coastal areas of Ivory Coast centuries ago. But it has travelled far beyond the country\\\'s borders to become one of the best known foods across French-speaking Africa and the diaspora in Europe and North America.It is cooked in several different ways. The most popular is \"attieke poisson grillee\" - prepared with fried fish and sliced tomato, onion and green pepper. There\\\'s also \"attieke sauce tomate\" - a tomato sauce cooked with fresh or dry fish. A third is \"attieke huile rouge\". In this case the couscous is mixed with palm oil, which turns its almond colour to orange, accompanied with a hot pepper soup. It can also be eaten with grilled chicken or smoked fish.Attieke is traditionally made by women in villages across the country and in the outskirts of Ivorian main cities, especially in southern and central Ivory Coast.The cassava root is peeled, grated and mixed with a previously fermented cassava. The pulp is then pressed to remove the starch and later processed manually and dried and then steamed.It is then sold in local markets, in both individual portions and larger bags.One of the main reasons the Ivorian government gave is that many people outside Ivory Coast - in Africa and even south-east Asia - claim to be making and selling attieke. They use the Ivorian unique style name and brand to sell their product while \"they are using only a part of the process\", government spokesman Bruno Kone said.The announcement follows a severe shortage of attieke in Ivory Coast\\\'s markets this year, leading President Alassane Ouattara to blame \"cartels\" and ask police to investigate and dismantle them.Trade unions and consumer organisations applauded Mr Ouattara and his decision received unanimous support in a country often divided by politics and with raw memories of two decades of crisis and the 2010-2011 post-election war.A sign that attieke is one of few things that still unites Ivory Coast\\\'s 20 million people from 62 ethnic backgrounds.The Ivorian government is asking the African Regional Intellectual Property Organization to protect attieke. But Aripo does not have a compliance policing unit so it is not clear how it would be enforced on the continent, let alone elsewhere.Given that markets in Ivory Coast and elsewhere in West Africa are full of pirated music and DVDs, it is hard to see anyone going round to inspect bags of attieke and confiscate any that are not certified.Read more: ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36986299','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-08-07 09:00:40',1),(96,'Africa\'s top shots: 5 - 11 August 2016','A selection of the best photos from across Africa this week.',' Images courtesy of AFP, AP, EPA and Reuters','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37051374','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-08-12 18:47:11',1),(97,'Child\'s first sight','Criscent Bwambale, six, sees for the first time after an operation to remove cataracts in Uganda.','For the first six years of his life Criscent Bwambale was one of 18 million people in the developing world currently estimated to be living with preventable blindness. He was born with cataracts, able to make out only vague areas of light and dark. In Uganda, where Criscent lives with his grandmother in a mud-built house surrounded by cocoa plantations, that means almost total exclusion from normal life. He couldn\\\'t go to school or play with other children his age, and had to rely on his family for even the most basic tasks.In January, the family responded to a call from a Ugandan medical team supported by international charity Sightsavers, to submit their children for eye tests, which resulted in Criscent undergoing double cataract surgery at a hospital in Mbarara to the west of the country.  Two months later, vision therapist Nelson Chwa examines Criscent\\\'s eyes before fitting him with spectacles, allowing him to see the world clearly for the first time. A doctor puts new glasses on Criscent for the first time.Old spectacle frames lie in a box at the Ruharo Eye Hospital, one of the few clinics offering specialist services for Uganda\\\'s estimated 368,000 blind people.Criscent strides out of the Eye hospital with his new glasses. \"Before the operation he relied on his grandmother or another member of his family to do everything for him. But now he\\\'s a confident and independent little boy,\" said Joseph Magyezi, a hospital official.On the journey back to his home village of Bundibugyo, Criscent looks out of the car window with amazement.The road passes through spectacular scenery in the foothills of the Rwenzori mountains in the far west of the country.Back home, Criscent\\\'s cousin lifts him up to show him the view out of the window. His family now have the task of teaching him what basic everyday objects are. \"His siblings are all happy and excited. They are all elated that their brother can now see,\" said his grandmother.\"He needs to learn to recognise things and their names. For example, he has never seen a boat or a chicken, so he does not know what these are called,\" said Magyezi.Criscent sits in class on his first ever day in school. He has never seen letters before, and must learn the alphabet from scratch. \"He has lost many years of learning and his brain now needs to catch up with what he sees,\" said Magyezi.Criscent joins in a game with other students in his class at a local primary school. \"I\\\'ve never played like that before,\" said Criscent, whose blindness used to prevent him from taking part in games with other children.Criscent\\\'s cousin explains to him what a flower is outside the family\\\'s home in Bundibugyo. \"Having vision is a process,\" says Magyezi. \"Once Criscent gets his glasses he will learn to use his eyes through what he sees through them.

Members of a parliamentary committee on the environment noticed the lack of priorities and were not impressed.It is also clear that the pressure on a ranger can come from their own, so it is little wonder that some of them are turning from game keeper to poacher just to stay alive.Zimbabwe has managed to capture two of its most-wanted poaching suspects in the last week, Altogether 10 suspects were arrested in separate operations, though its report shows the difficulty of tracking down poachers.The tools of their trade may be simple - the paper lists some being arrested with a couple of rifles, a silencer, ammunition, a knife, a torch and a getaway car - but their collusion with local chiefs makes them more lethal to animals and rangers alike.It is no surprise that the deaths of elephants and rangers in DR Congo were at the hands of armed militias, and that South Sudan\\\'s protracted rebellions have affected animals and the men and women who try to protect them.The director of South Sudan\\\'s Lantoto National Game Park, where 10 elephants were killed by poachers in June, says the instability in his country is to blame.\"You know animals are like people and when there is continuous presence of fighting and hunting down in the country, they tend to run away in search of peaceful environment,\" Col Natalino Lasuba recently He said park rangers faced challenges including heavy rains, lack of logistical and communication equipment, inadequate numbers - as well as the inevitable clashes with armed poachers.Virunga National Park in DR Congo - home to the endangered gorillas and Africa\\\'s oldest park - documents the rangers who die in the line of duty and has set up One of the latest to die was 40-year-old Sebinyenzi Bavukirahe Yacinthe, who left behind a wife and eight children aged between two and 16 in January.While Fidele Mulonga Mulegalega and Venant Mumbere Muvesevese were killed in an attack by Mai Mai rebels in March.\"These deaths break the unfathomable barrier of 150 rangers lost in a decade here in Virunga, over 10 of those in the last year alone,\" the park\\\'s director Emmanuel de Merode said in a statement at the time. \"Despite the wide progress we make here in many areas, we cannot sustain these kind of losses in what is still the most dangerous conservation job in the world.\"Whether it is South Sudan\\\'s Boma National Park, DR Congo\\\'s Garamba National Park or Kruger National Park in South Africa, the poachers are increasing their firepower and the fallout for the rangers is severe.Not only are rangers\\\' lives being lost to increased poaching, there is also the psychological fallout. It is creating a new kind of \"ranger trauma\" to seeing so many butchered animals littering the savannah, including those of rhino and elephant calves.The animals too do not distinguish between poacher or ranger so some of the dead rangers have been trampled to death by the elephants they were protecting.Considering that more than 14,000 elephants have been killed between 2003 and 2015, it barely registers as a concern for most African governments.African governments should treat the prevalence of armed poaching as a national security emergency, and dedicate a large chunk of the defence budget to combating it robustly.The ranger is in a war few acknowledge is happening on World Ranger Day and every day.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36951644','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-08-04 07:12:13',1),(106,'Elizabeth Ohene: What\'s worse - malaria or smell of chickens?','In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene considers a dilemma over possible malaria prevention.','In our series of letters from African journalists, Ghanaian writer Elizabeth Ohene considers a dilemma over possible malaria prevention.About the most exciting news story I have heard in recent times is the report that the scent of chicken keeps malarial mosquitoes away. I ought to probably declare that I have what might easily be described as an obsession with malaria.It is not just that malaria happens to be the greatest killer in Ghana and the biggest reason the majority of people go to outpatient departments in hospitals here - I have a personal problem with malaria. You need to have had malaria to appreciate just how dreadful a disease it is.Thirty years after my last bout, I cannot forget the fever, the flu-like symptoms, the high temperatures, the chills, the headache, muscle aches, tiredness, nausea, vomiting and diarrhoea; and that is when you do not have any complications.To put it mildly, malaria is not a pleasant thing. It is debilitating and it reduces grown men to helplessness and kills the majority of young people in my country. But some say the presence of malaria in our part of the world has had some advantages in our history. According to this theory, malaria played a significant role in the spread of colonialism on the African continent.In the parts of the continent that did not have malaria, Europeans could and did settle.However, in West Africa they could not and this contributed to an easier liberation struggle when the time came. Indeed, some have suggested that a monument should be erected for the mosquito because it was deemed to have saved West Africa from the fate of southern Africa and the difficulties that came with the independence struggle. I have never been persuaded that the deterrence to European settlement in West Africa was a worthwhile trade-off for the havoc caused to us by the presence of the malarial mosquito in our part of the world, but that is an argument that will doubtless continue. It also does not detract from the reality of just how horrible malaria is. How you contract malaria is just as bad as the disease itself. There is nothing more dreadful on this Earth than the \"hmmmmnnn\" sound which wakes you up and alerts you to the fact that you have been bitten by the dreaded female anopheles mosquito and infected with the malaria parasite.I am also in the unfortunate situation that none of the anti-malaria prophylactics work for me. I break out in rashes or I get dizzy and if truth be told, I don\\\'t really like sleeping under mosquito nets.In the past 16 years that I have been back in malarial Ghana, I have dealt with the problem by simply trying to avoid being bitten.Thus far, it has worked but it has taken an almighty effort that I would not really wish on anybody.    It is with this background that I come to the new scientific discovery that might help eliminate malaria. Ethiopian and Swedish scientists are said to have discovered that the answer to the malaria problem might lie with the lowly chicken. Malarial mosquitoes apparently The experiments, conducted in western Ethiopia, are said to have included suspending a live chicken in a cage near a volunteer sleeping under a bed net.Compounds extracted from chicken feathers were also used in the experiments, as well as live chickens. OK, so I adore chicken; the meat, that is, but I am not sure about the scent of chicken in my bedroom. The thought of having to decide between the scent of chickens in my bedroom or the sound of the anopheles mosquito or being ravaged by malaria is most unappealing.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36894631','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-07-27 07:26:47',1),(107,'Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani: Resigning gracefully','In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at David Cameron\'s resignation after the vote to leave the European Union and asks whether there are any lessons for Africa.','In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at the spate of resignations in the UK after the vote to leave the European Union and asks whether there are any lessons for Africa.After failing to convince the British people of the need to Remain in the European Union, Prime Minister David Cameron knew that his time was up. He felt he was not the right person to lead the country.  Without waiting for street protests or endless appeals from the United Nations, Mr Cameron announced his resignation, giving way to someone better equipped to manage the new situation that Britain found itself in.  Africans can now appreciate that there is no need for melodramatic performances when it comes to leaving office and importantly, not unusual for a leader to step down before his term ends. It is even possible to go out on a jaunty note, as Mr Cameron did, whistling to the tune of D\\\'Banj\\\'s Olorun Maje.     Immediately after Britain voted to leave the EU, the country\\\'s political establishment was thrown into chaos. The uncertainty in the currency markets led to the pound falling to a 30-year low. And confidence in doing business in the UK seemed to be ebbing. The UK\\\'s unity was in jeopardy, with the possibility of Scotland pulling out of the union.  Britain was facing a crisis.  But the country did not accuse the international media of presenting an exaggerated impression to the world of how bad things were.  They did not sit back and watch their country fall completely apart, before they took action. As quickly as possible, the ruling Conservative party did away with the prospect of a prolonged leadership battle, recognising that collective energy was better expended on tackling the looming crisis head on.Experts who had warned of turmoil if the Leave campaign won rehashed their predictions but they started offering solutions on how the UK would cope with life outside the EU.The Chancellor of the Exchequer who had campaigned for the Remain side quickly changed gear and declared that Britain was \"open for business\". And as soon as Theresa May took over, she announced her cabinet without much ado, everyone expected to begin work immediately.  No time for lengthy, and televised, courtesy calls from her villagers and church members and the market women association and the traditional rulers and her old girls association and her husband\\\'s villagers - all of them wanting her to know, via hours-long speeches, that they support her and wish her well.  As far as we know, Mrs May spent her first night in office at Number 10 Downing Street, the official residence of the British Prime Minister, never mind that she may have stayed awake all night drawing up her cabinet list.  How many African leaders would dare do such a thing? Occupy a residence just vacated by a predecessor without first inviting native doctors or shamans or pastors to sanctify the place and cleanse it of any spiritual booby traps, while commanding the witches and wizards lurking in the woodwork to either return to sender or fall down and die.And Larry the cat is being allowed to stay.  The stray feline has lived in Downing Street since 2010, playing the role of chief mouse chaser.  Mrs May has not ordered that Larry be thrown out on suspicion of being a witch in cat form sent by political enemies to spy on her or pull her down. You need only watch a random selection of Nollywood films, which are immensely popular all over Africa, to understand that a stray cat in this part of the world is never just a stray cat.  Not to talk of a stray cat inherited from a political predecessor.  The UK is not in any way a perfect place. The country itself can learn a few things from the diverse ways of the African people.  But, when it comes to the matter of Mr Cameron\\\'s handover to Mrs May, we would do well to sit at the feet of Britain and learn.

If after voting to leave the European Union the UK is feeling lonely and in need of the company of another community of nations, it should consider the AU. The UK has been exhibiting qualities that are very familiar to Africans, including \"tribalism\".The tribe from the northernmost part of the UK, otherwise known as Scotland, has threatened to break away following the Brexit vote.The Scottish people overwhelmingly voted to remain in the EU, but their voice was drowned out by the southern tribes, where the majority voted to leave.UK cohesion could face further challenges if Scotland goes ahead with a new referendum to decide its future inside the UK.Africans are often accused of tribal politics, so the UK would be quite at home in the African Union.We are also seeing a leader, albeit of the opposition, hanging on to power despite sustained pressure for him to quit.Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, who is accused of performing badly in the referendum, is likely to face a leadership challenge after a vote of no confidence by MPs within his party.But he says he will remain in office, arguing that he was elected by a majority of Labour members.Africa has its fair share of leaders clinging to power for decades despite opposition to their rule.The current chaos, backstabbing, attempted leadership coups, dark room deal cutting, resignations, sackings and instant appointments inside UK political parties makes African leaders look like political novices.So in this respect, the UK might bring a transfer of knowledge to the AU.Hate and racism have also come out from the shadows to torment the UK, and Africa knows all too well the dangers of hate speech and hate crime.Since supporters of the Leave campaign won the referendum, there has been an increase in reports of hate crimes in the UK, with the police looking into incidents.Addressing parliament, British Prime Minister David Cameron acknowledged the problem and pledged more money to the police to tackle it.Campaigners on both sides of the Brexit issue used scare tactics in an attempt to sway the vote.Although violence was not used, some voters felt compelled to vote one way or the other without proven facts to support the fear.We know of a number of leaders in Africa who have won elections through threats and intimidation.In 1997, during the first election after In reference to the former rebels who were at the time seeking power by the ballot, some Liberians openly said: \"You killed my ma, you killed my pa, but I\\\'ll vote for you.\"The referendum result itself is not legally binding in UK law and it alone does not trigger the UK\\\'s departure from the EU - parliament may still debate and be asked to approve the process of leaving Europe.Again, Africans are very familiar with this phenomenon - they go to a referendum poll and express their views on an issue only for MPs to sit in the house and decide that the people misspoke. Then there is the question of the youth - there was a big contrast of opinion amongst different age groups in the Brexit vote.The majority of young people wanted the UK to remain in Europe, but they did not vote in large numbers. The older generation voted to leave.In Africa, the youth are the majority but their voice and presence in power is in the minority. I grew up being told that the youth are the leaders of the future.Now my teeth are almost falling out, while the bald patch on my head is starting to mimic a solar panel and I am still waiting for that future.So UK, welcome to the African Union.And once you join, you will benefit from our African solutions for African problems, which might suit Anglo-problems too.If you need to rebuild national unity after such a divisive poll, Kenya can help with its experience after the 2007 vote.South Africa too can offer you some guidance about restorative justice through the work of its Truth and Reconciliation Commission.And if you are worried about how to keep Scotland happy in the UK, Tanzania could share its experience of maintaining the union between mainland Tanganyika and Zanzibar.It is not an easy ride, but it is worth a try.In the meantime, African politicians have the unique talent of creating distractions - so people cannot focus on the problems.Some create wars that did not exist or artificial food shortages.But in your case, you have the perfect answer.You must focus on the Welsh football team\\\'s miracle in Euro 2016.

Trade, African economists argued, would change little but the duplication of aid packages from the EU and the UK would most likely increase as the UK sought to revive Commonwealth ties.Over in Johannesburg, people wondered why the local currency, the rand, kept falling against the British pound with all the financial uncertainty hanging like a mist over London\\\'s Square Mile; and in Kigali, money-transfer companies ceased trading in sterling for 24 hours so they could gauge the anticipated slide.Even as the dust settled last Friday morning on the UK\\\'s momentous decision to leave the EU, it was the voting intentions of Africans in Britain that made for fascinating reading.Some of them had argued to leave, and social media had been awash with the African Brexiteers\\\' pleas for the severing of ties with Europe, including WhatsApp circulars setting out the reasons.London has been home to Africans since long before William Shakespeare wrote Othello.Later, Africans settled in the capital during the height of the British Empire and at its end, contributing hugely to the city\\\'s multicultural heartbeat.In comparison with the rest of the EU, Africans have long valued the opportunities available to them in the UK and the protection the law accords them.Despite many problems, a Race Relations Act of 1976 has tried to give them shade from the glaring heat of prejudice; they have educated their children, opened up places to worship, bought property and settled. They have generally felt safer over the years in the UK than in the other 27 EU countries.Better the devil you know, the pro-Brexit Africans said, arguing that the rest of Europe is notorious for its absence of colour in public office and cultural life - despite the many stars of African origin currently featuring in France\\\'s European football bonanza - and its marginalisation of generations of African migrants in forgotten high-rise estates.In any case, their argument went, the expansion of the EU had drastically reduced the job chances of Africans from the Commonwealth and beyond. Employers did not worry about visas for EU citizens, and a huge pool of labour with freedom of movement had simply locked out non-EU citizens from the skilled as well as the unskilled job market.Even the NHS and care sector, which had relied so much on African professionals, began to forget them in favour of the new EU arrivals.It was also feared that with Albania, Turkey, Serbia, Macedonia and Montenegro waiting to join the EU, the African worker could tumble to the bottom of the working pile.And this argument was put across persistently.The referendum debate could not escape the thorny issue of immigration, and the African migrant who voted to leave was as fearful of the new arrivals, of his or her chances in a crowded job and housing market, as was his indigenous British neighbour. Senior politicians said during the debates that their constituents in London were bemoaning the lack of places for their children in local schools because of the burgeoning numbers coming from Eastern Europe, and such complaints were, Yet the Africans awoke to a post-Brexit Britain that was as full of prejudice to the non-EU citizen as to the EU citizen.Bitter graffiti appeared urging all foreigners to leave.People were targeted on the streets because they were black, brown, wore a turban or had an accent.One tweet, Prejudice, it seems, has been released through the pressure valve of the referendum and the pro-Brexit voters did not count on that.And now there are more questions than answers as people wonder what will replace the EU as a trading and development partner. The Commonwealth lost its economic clout with the end of colonies. And China is decades ahead of the old colonial rulers in terms of influence on the African continent. Then there is a possible indicator of what the future may hold: Europe\\\'s opposition parties in France, Holland and Austria have lurched dangerously to the right, and the UK may not have escaped that trend.The African Brexiteers may find that life after Brexit may be little different to life before the referendum, except for the nagging uncertainty.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36643891','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-06-28 08:06:19',1),(110,'Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani: Nigeria\'s war of the robes','In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at how the latest religious tension in Nigeria is playing out in what people wear to school.','In our series of letters from African journalists, novelist and writer Adaobi Tricia Nwaubani looks at how the latest religious tension in Nigeria is playing out in what people wear to school.Almost all of Nigeria\\\'s many inter-religious crises have erupted in the north of the country, where the majority of the country\\\'s Muslims live, along with a sizeable Christian minority. But, over the past few weeks, a religious conflict of a peculiar nature has sprouted in Osun state, south-west Nigeria, which has a large population of Muslims as well as Christians. While previous religious conflicts have involved machetes, the battle in Osun is being fought with religious garments.It\\\'s the war of the religious robes.Back in the beginning of June a judge ruled that female Muslims who attend public schools in the state could wear their hijabs to class.  The state\\\'s branch of the Christian Association of Nigeria (Can) said Christian students would wear garments associated with church activities to schools if the state governor implemented the court ruling.And they made good on their threat.On 14 June some Christian students in the state\\\'s schools turned up wearing church clothes over their school uniforms.Some wore maroon choir robes and others donned ankle-length, white garments.The photos of the students provided a comic relief.But the war of the robes did not begin with the hijab ruling. It goes back to 2012, when Governor Rauf Aregbesola approved the demolition of the Fakunle High School to make way for, as the rumour goes, the construction of a mall. We Nigerians love our malls. But we love our religion even more. And Fakunle High School was originally a Christian missionary school.The school\\\'s alumni organised a peaceful protest but the governor still went ahead with the demolition. Shortly afterwards, Mr Aregbesola announced plans to \"reclassify\" schools in the state, further frightening the Christian community into suspecting that he had a hidden agenda. \"There are indications that Governor Rauf Aregbesola of Osun State is nursing the ambition of Islamising the state,\" said Reverend Musa Asake, Can\\\'s General Secretary.The reclassification entailed merging some schools. For example, some male students were dispatched to the Baptist Girls\\\' High School in the state capital, Osogbo, while some Muslim students were asked to join the Baptist High School in another town, Iwo.In a letter to the governor, the Osun chapter of Can opposed the plan, alleging that \"the foundation of the Christian faith is being threatened by some of the state government policies especially in the education sector\".Despite a peaceful demonstration and a seven-day ultimatum, the governor went ahead and merged the schools.\"No single group, organisation, individual, religious or social body\\\'s interest would suffer as a result of the ongoing re-classification and reform,\" Mr Aregbesola assured in a statement.But while schools, such as the Baptist High School, ultimately complied with the directive, they drew the line at allowing Muslim students to turn up for classes wearing the hijab.Thus began a litany of accusations and counter-accusations, with several media reports alleging harassment of students by teachers, and violence against teachers by recalcitrant students.  Hijabs were reportedly yanked off students\\\' heads, and students allegedly beat up disapproving teachers.At some point, a Muslim group in the state organised a protest, which saw Muslim students marching from school to school. Fearing a \"breakdown of law and order\", the state government temporarily shut down schools in the state.Eventually, the Muslim association in the state took the matter to court. After three long years, Justice Jide Falola ruled at the beginning of June that the use of hijabs by female Muslim students in Osun was their fundamental human right to freedom of religion.Thus began the present crisis.\\xe2\\x80\\x8e\"We are appealing the judgement, but Christian pupils will continue to wear church garments to their various schools,\" said Moses Ogundeji, Can vice-chairman in the state.Professor Ishaq Akintola, director of the state\\\'s Muslim Rights Concern group, described Can\\\'s reaction to the court\\\'s decision as \"impunity of the highest order\", adding that the wearing of hijab was an \"Allah-given fundamental right to female Muslims students\".One can only imagine the impact of all this commotion on the Osun state students who are expected to study amid such tension.

The political and ethnic violence that ensued claimed the lives of more than 1,000 Kenyans and forced hundreds of thousands to flee their homes. \"We nearly lost Kenya,\" were the words that Kofi Annan, former UN secretary-general and mediator in the Kenyan crisis, used to describe the mayhem that greeted the announcement of the final election result in December of 2007.Nearly nine years later, and with lessons of the 59-day violence seemingly forgotten, Kenyans are once more pinning their country to the ground and holding a can of petrol in one hand and a box of matches in the other. As a journalist who has been covering Kenya and Africa since 1989 I am now a worried man.  If nothing is done to pacify the society and cool the temperatures that have been recklessly raised by politicians, this nation could burn. And if it does, the blaze will be a lot more fierce and destructive than in 2008.In the last year, social media has continued to light up with hate speech. Commentary and posts are being screened and responded to through ethnic lenses. In one conversation packed with ethnic vitriol, a contributor commented:\"Going by the comments here, it confirms the fact that there is hidden animosity in Kenya and one day 2007/2008 violence will look like child\\\'s play. We will be worse than what happened in Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo combined.\"Eight elected politicians were recently arrested and detained in police custody for three days on charges of hate speech. One is accused of calling for the eviction of one community from Nakuru region in the Rift Valley, while another alluded to the assassination of opposition leader Raila Odinga. At the centre of the current spike in political fever is the government and opposition stand-off regarding electoral reform.In the last few weeks, Monday has been turned into a day of political protests. The opposition has been calling their supporters onto the streets to push for the reforms by marching to the offices of the electoral commission. And the response from the police has predictably been a healthy dose of tear gas, in an attempt to break up the demonstrations.Four people have so far died in clashes between police and protesters.Mondays are now called \"machozi Monday\" - Swahili for \"tear gas Monday\". And the area around the offices of the electoral commission is now baptised \"shisha corner\" because of the heavy tear gas that fills the air.So who are some of the main actors in this political drama and what do they want? I have selected seven of the key players:He wants to continue occupying the residence he has known since childhood when his father, Jomo Kenyatta, was president - namely State House.In other words he wants to be re-elected president for a second five-year term in the coming general election.He has been forced to accept that he negotiate a way out of the impasse with the opposition.But he wants this dialogue to be conducted through a parliamentary process, because he \"swore to uphold and defend the constitution\".What he does not want is a street solution. He saw what the Arab Spring did to those in power. He has vowed to crack down hard on hate speech and his government has not spared leaders accused of spreading ethnic hatred.The authorities have made the eight MPs arrested an example by denying them bail and forcing them to suffer in the infamous cold and miserable police cells for three nights.Poster boy of the opposition, he leads the Coalition for Reforms and Democracy (Cord), an umbrella grouping of several political parties.Mr Odinga wants what his late father Jaramogi Oginga Odinga tried and failed to achieve for many years - enter State House. Among other things he wants a total overhaul of the electoral commission and direct appointment of the commissioners. He believes the body as currently constituted is not credible and cannot oversee a credible electoral process in 2017.He does not want reforms through a parliamentary process. He knows very well the current government has enough numbers in the house to frustrate his efforts.He is the MP for Gatundu South, a constituency in central Kenya that has produced two presidents - Jomo Kenyatta and Uhuru Kenyatta. He is Kenya\\\'s Donald Trump (minus the billions and the presidential ambition): Straight-talking, unpredictable and uncontrollable.He wants the opposition to tremble in their boots as they prepare for dialogue.For the umpteenth time Mr Kuria is in trouble and facing serious charges of hate speech. Many Kenyans view him as the government\\\'s kamikaze - a force of self-destruction that also conveniently distracts attention from the ruling establishment.He is the senator for Machakos County and a prominent opposition voice. He is wealthy, loud and bold. He will say the unsayable and often makes the government quite uncomfortable.Mr Muthama is one of the eight legislators who were arrested for hate speech.He is the chairman and face of the Independent Electoral and Boundaries Commission (IEBC).He does not want to go home - at least not yet.He wants both government and the opposition to leave him and his team alone to continue preparing for next year\\\'s election, arguing that a change of guard now will have a negative impact on the 2017 elections.It is a non-lethal chemical weapon that irritates the eyes, mouth, lungs and skin.In Kenya, it is personified by the cabinet secretary in charge of internal security, Joseph Nkaissery.The former military man talks and acts tough.In mid-May he cautioned opposition protesters: \"Let them be warned that I have enough tear gas - which I will not run short of soon - to use in smoking them out of IEBC offices if they attempt to force themselves there.\"Throughout Kenya\\\'s history, in the absence of talks to resolve political disputes, tear gas talks.I have personal experience of this having inhaled enough tear gas as a student and journalist - from being caught up in the streets of Nairobi during a violent military operation to suppress an attempted air force coup against President Daniel arap Moi in August 1982 to reporting the countrywide demonstrations demanding an end to single party authoritarian rule in July 1990. This is a Swahili term meaning the ordinary citizen of Kenya. Every political blow unleashed, every tear gas canister fired and every word uttered is done in his/her name.But the mwananchi is not present at the ongoing talks to reform that key institution that will referee the election and shape the future.Many wananchi (Swahili plural for citizens) noted two striking photographs that remind them of their true place. One was an image from 2008 that showed then-President Mwai Kibaki, Mr Odinga and Mr Annan sharing soft drinks in a relaxed atmosphere soon after the country went ablaze with Kenyans fighting the two rivals\\\' battles.The second photo was of a recent event and showed President Uhuru and Mr Odinga in a jovial moment at State House, while out in the streets life was disrupted as clashes between security forces and protesters ensued on behalf of the two men.But it is this same mwananchi who will be called upon to decide which man goes into rent-free accommodation at State House in next year\\\'s election.If mwananchi makes the wrong choice, the soil of Kenya will drink his blood and the mass grave will quickly fill up.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-36602399','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-06-27 15:48:23',1),(112,'Africa\'s top shots: 12-18 August 2016','A selection of the best photos from across Africa this week.',' Images courtesy of AFP, AP, EPA, Getty Images and Reuters','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37118171','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-08-20 01:26:23',1),(113,'Abortion provider Marie Stopes suspends services','A leading provider of abortions in England has suspended terminations under general anaesthetic, and those to under 18s, following inspections by healthcare inspectors.','One of England\\\'s main abortion providers has suspended terminations under general anaesthetic, and to under 18s, following inspections by healthcare inspectors.The Care Quality Commission raised concerns about patient safety before Marie Stopes International suspended a number of services.NHS England said the move would affect around 250 women a week.However those affected would be diverted to other services.

The plan also calls on primary schools to deliver at least 30 minutes of physical activity a day and to help parents and carers ensure children get the same amount at home. School sports will also get more funds - boosted by The childhood obesity strategy also says:Much of the response to the government\\\'s childhood obesity plan has been critical. Even one of the big supermarket chains has suggested it does not go far enough. Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\\\'s, says there should be a tougher regime including compulsory targets for sugar and mandatory traffic light labelling.  The government plan involves a voluntary 20% sugar reduction scheme. Theresa May seems to have concluded that the sugar levy on soft drinks - Health organisations and campaigners are almost universally of the view there should have been wider action. Some, though, acknowledge that the package unveiled today, including a boost for school sport, is a step in the right direction, albeit a small one.Dr Wollaston - who is chairwoman of the health select committee - said it was \"really disappointing\" that \"whole sections from the original draft have been dropped\", including measures on advertising junk food to children and on promotions such as two-for-one deals.She told BBC Radio 5 Live that these could have made a \"real difference really quickly\", and added: \"I\\\'m afraid it does show the hand of big industry lobbyists and that\\\'s really disappointing.\"She welcomed measures on cutting sugar in foods and keeping the tax on sugary drinks, but said it would be some time before these took effect.Referring to Prime Minister Theresa May\\\'s pledge to tackle heath inequality, Dr Wollaston said the government should not make such promises then - as the \"first litmus test of that\" - put the \"interests of advertising marketers ahead of the interests of children\".Labour\\\'s Dianne Abbott But Jane Ellison, Financial Secretary to the Treasury, said the plan was the \"most ambitious programme of reformulation that any developed country has taken\".Ms Ellison, who was formerly the public health minister involved in drawing up the strategy, said the government was acting on the \"best advice\" from public health experts.Asked about concerns the government had \"watered down\" the proposals to limit junk food advertising, she said the UK already had some of the \"toughest restrictions in the world\". A Department of Health spokeswoman added: \"The childhood obesity crisis has been decades in the making and it will take years to sort it. We will measure progress carefully and are not ruling out further action if results are not seen.\"Professor Parveen Kumar, chairwoman of the British Medical Association\\\'s board of science, said the government had \"rowed back on its promises by announcing what looks like a weak plan rather than the robust strategy it promised\".\"Although the government proposes targets for food companies to reduce the level of sugar in their products, the fact that these are voluntary and not backed up by regulation, renders them pointless,\" she said.TV chef and food campaigner Jamie Oliver said he was \"in shock\" at the \"disappointing\" plan.\"It contains a few nice ideas, but so much is missing,\" he \"It was set to be one of the most important health initiatives of our time, but look at the words used - \\\'should, might, we encourage\\\' - too much of it is voluntary, suggestive, where are the mandatory points?\"The Obesity Health Alliance - a coalition of 33 charities, medical royal colleges and campaign groups - said the plan fell \"disappointingly short of what is needed\", with some anticipated measures \"significantly watered down or removed entirely\".Sir Harpal Kumar, chief executive of the charity Cancer Research UK, said the measures were a \"missed opportunity\" in the fight against childhood obesity.Councillor Izzi Seccombe, of the Local Government Association, said it was \"disappointing\" that a number of measures that it had called for - such as giving councils the power to ban junk food adverts near schools - had not been included.Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury\\\'s, said the plan was a \"welcome first step\".But he said: \"We need a holistic approach to tackle childhood obesity, including compulsory measured targets across all nutrients - not just sugar - and mandatory traffic light labelling across all food and drink products, regardless of whether they are consumed inside or outside the home.\"Ian Wright, of the Food and Drink Federation, said: \"Soft drink companies are already making great progress to reduce sugars from their products, having achieved a 16% reduction between 2012 and 2016.   \"Indeed, many individual manufacturers have a proud track record of reformulation to remove salt, fat and sugar from food and drinks and this work will continue.\"He said the target to reduce sugar was \"flawed\" because it focused on \"the role of this single nutrient, when obesity is caused by excess calories from any nutrient\".Gavin Partington, of the British Soft Drinks Association, said his industry had been \"singled out\" by the \"punitive\" tax on sugary drinks.He called for more \"holistic\" policy on obesity which did not \"pick on one category\".','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37108767','2016-08-20 10:46:50','2016-08-18 19:26:33',1),(117,'Nottinghamshire dentist Desmond D\'Mello struck off by General Dental Council','A dentist who sparked \"the biggest NHS patient recall in history\" is struck off.','A dentist who sparked \"the biggest NHS patient recall in history\" has been struck off.A total of 55 allegations of malpractice against Desmond D\\\'Mello were proven during a General Dental Council (GDC) misconduct hearing.Secret filming exposed poor levels of cleanliness at the Daybrook Dental Practice, near Nottingham.

Scientists at University College London (UCL) say their early animal tests could lead to a cheap and non-invasive way to spot the disease. Parkinson\\\'s affects 1 in 500 people and is the second most common neurodegenerative disease worldwide. The charity Parkinson\\\'s UK welcomed the research as a \"significant step\".The researchers examined rats and found that changes could be seen at the back of their eyes before visible symptoms occurred.Professor Francesca Cordeiro who led the research said it was a \"potentially revolutionary breakthrough in the early diagnosis and treatment of one of the world\\\'s most debilitating diseases\". \"These tests mean we might be able to intervene much earlier and more effectively treat people with this devastating condition.\" Symptoms of Parkinson\\\'s include tremors and muscle stiffness, slowness of movement and a reduced quality of life.These symptoms usually only emerge after brain cells have been damaged.But there is currently no brain scan, or blood test, that can definitively diagnose Parkinson\\\'s disease.Parkinson\\\'s does not directly cause people to die, but symptoms do get worse over time.Dr Arthur Roach, director of research at the charity Parkinson\\\'s UK, said there was \"an urgent need for a simple and accurate way of detecting the condition, particularly in its early stages\". \"Although the research is in its infancy and is yet to be tested on people with Parkinson\\\'s, a simple non-invasive test - such as an eye test - could be a significant step forward in the search for treatments that can tackle the underlying causes of the condition rather than masking its symptoms,\" he added.Dr Roach pointed out that the charity was funding parallel research which is trying to identify Parkinson\\\'s bio-markers, which are measureable changes in people with the condition. \"Having a biomarker for Parkinson\\\'s would help diagnose Parkinson\\\'s earlier, when people are most likely to benefit from the new treatments aimed at slowing progression,\" he explained.The UCL researchers used medical equipment that doctors already use and say the potential new method could also be used to monitor how patients respond to treatment.

The NHF said this particular group of people had grown by 42% since 2008.In 2006, some \\xc2\\xa34.6bn in housing benefit was paid to private landlords, a figure which had more than doubled by 2015.NHF chief executive David Orr said: \"It is madness to spend \\xc2\\xa39bn of taxpayers\\\' money lining the pockets of private landlords rather than investing in affordable homes.\"\"The lack of affordable housing available means that a wider group of people need housing benefit,\" he added.Had these housing benefit claimants been living in social housing instead of renting from private landlords, taxpayers would have saved huge sums of money over seven years, the NHF report estimated.It said that taxpayers paid \\xc2\\xa31,000 more per year, per family renting in the private rented sector, than they did for those in social housing.This amounted to an average of \\xc2\\xa32.2bn a year extra being handed over to private landlords, at a cumulative additional cost of \\xc2\\xa315.6bn over the past seven years, the NHF analysis says.If this extra housing benefit bill for just one year had been spent on creating new affordable housing, the NHF added, then nearly 50,000 new homes could have been built.The report also points out that a larger proportion of families claiming housing benefit in the private rented sector are now in work.\"Today, nearly half (47%) of all families claiming housing benefit in the private rented sector are in work - this is nearly double the proportion it was six years ago (26%),\" the NHF said.

Could this be partly thanks to instructions they received about pubic hair?Some time ago, after a number of riders complained about saddle soreness, British Cycling organised a conference of experts to find a solution. The sages advised tilting the saddles at a slightly different angle and encouraging the athletes to stop waxing or shaving their bikini lines. Pubic hair, it turns out, helps protect against friction and remove sweat from the skin.Issuing these instructions made for some uncomfortable conversations. \"It was a tricky one to broach,\" Phil Burt, British Cycling\\\'s long-time physiotherapist, But it seems to have worked.

Indeed, two years ago the company\\\'s operations director Ryan Graves told me that focussing on self-driving cars was a \"fool\\\'s errand\" in the short term and that nobody would be getting in one in the next few years. So, the news that self-driving Ubers will be available to customers in Pittsburgh later this month comes as a huge surprise.  It will be a wake-up call to Google - which has done so much work in this field but has yet to launch any kind of commercial service - and to Mr Musk\\\'s Tesla, currently battling adverse publicity over the reliability of its Autopilot function.  It is also a measure of just how much money Uber has invested in its automated driving research programme - but having raised over $10 billion (\\xc2\\xa37.6bn) from backers, the company has plenty of financial firepower at its disposal. One caveat however - the \"self-driving\" Volvos picking up Uber users will still have a human in the driving seat as a supervisor. Even if Uber was confident enough in the technology to dispense with a human, neither Pittsburgh nor any other city is ready to adapt its regulations to allow completely autonomous driving. And that means that Uber\\\'s latest coup is an impressive piece of marketing for its vision of the future of transport, but will prove a very expensive way of ferrying people around for some years to come.Some of Uber\\\'s know-how in the field of self-driving vehicles has come via its agreement to purchase Otto, a start-up founded by former Google employees to develop driverless trucks.Otto was co-founded by Anthony Levandowski, whose previous start-up, 510 Systems, was bought by Google when it began its own self-driving vehicles project.Volvo has already been testing self-driving versions of the same vehicle in The firm has also trialled the vehicle in \"I think it works well and I think it\\\'s a good small step to be taking,\" Mr Stevens told the BBC.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37117831','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-18 22:45:48',1),(127,'Internet spying powers backed by review','Britain\'s spies should be allowed to continue harvesting internet data, the government\'s reviewer of terror laws has said in a review.','Britain\\\'s spies should be allowed to continue harvesting large amounts of data from emails, the government\\\'s reviewer of terror legislation said.David Anderson has published He found there was no viable alternative to the use of the powers by GCHQ, MI5 and MI6 in the fight against terror.He also backed the hacking of phones and computers \"in principle\", with some reservations.The operational case for this kind of surveillance, known as \"bulk equipment interference,\" was \"not yet proven\" as it had yet to be used, he said.His findings are a boost for Prime Minister Theresa May, who ordered the review when she was home secretary, in response to privacy concerns raised by Labour.Many of the practices investigated by Mr Anderson, who was given access to details of operations by British spies in Afghanistan and other foreign territories, had been secret until recently.They will be put on a firm legal footing by the government\\\'s Investigatory Powers Bill, dubbed the \"snooper\\\'s charter\" by critics, which is due to return to Parliament later this year.The review focused on the activities of the security services and did not examine the case for the retention of internet records for 12 months - the other controversial aspect of the bill. In a statement, Mrs May said: \"Mr Anderson\\\'s report demonstrates how the bulk powers contained in the Investigatory Powers Bill are of crucial importance to our security and intelligence agencies. \"These powers often provide the only means by which our agencies are able to protect the British public from the most serious threats that we face. It is vital that we retain them, while ensuring their use is subject to robust safeguards and world-leading oversight which are enshrined in the IP Bill.\"Shadow Home Secretary Andy Burnham welcomed the report but said it was \"concerning\" that Mrs May had not accepted it in full. \"She and the home secretary must accept the report in its entirety and deliver on the separate concessions extracted by Labour in the Commons - tougher restrictions on the use of Internet Connection Records and stronger protections for journalists and lawyers,\" he said.Bulk interception differs from targeted interception - bugging a suspect\\\'s phone for example - in that it involves the harvesting of large quantities of data from the internet and emails. The data is then sifted and sorted by investigators.In his review, David Anderson said bulk powers were used by Britain\\\'s spy agencies for \"cyber-defence, counter-espionage and counterterrorism,\" as well as investigations into child sexual abuse and organised crime.

That\\\'s when I noticed that sometimes when a parent was by itself in the nest, incubating the egg, it produced a quite different call.\"I wondered - hmm, are they talking to their eggs?\"When she started to study this squeaky serenade in detail, combing through Dr Mariette found that the birds were specifically singing it in the few days before eggs hatched - and only when the day\\\'s ambient temperature rose above about 26C.\"It\\\'s not that they do it spontaneously whenever it\\\'s hot; they do it when it\\\'s hot and when the embryos could potentially hear them,\" she said.To figure out the specific effect of the calls, Dr Mariette and her colleague Katherine Buchanan used zebra finches living in the university\\\'s outdoor aviaries.They collected eggs and, for the final five days of their incubation, played them either a recording of the birds\\\' special egg-song, or a typical parent-to-parent call instead.As soon as they hatched, the 175 chicks were returned to various nests and the team observed the youngsters\\\' development in detail.To begin with, the two groups were indistinguishable; the song hadn\\\'t changed the chicks\\\' hatching weight. Within a few days, however, that changed.\"We found that, depending on whether or not they had heard the \\\'hot call\\\' from their parents, they reacted differently to heat,\" Dr Mariette explained. \"They adjusted their growth to temperature differently, and also solicited food from their parents differently.\"Specifically, the \"heat song\" seemed to make the chicks develop slower - and remain lighter - if their nest was in a hot corner of the aviary. Being a lightweight is generally bad news in evolutionary terms, but when the researchers followed the finches\\\' fortunes into adulthood, it proved the opposite: those lighter birds that grew up in hot nests produced significantly more fledglings than their heavier childhood companions.Furthermore, the chicks that were primed with a \"heat song\" in the egg went on to prefer warmer nesting spots.\"It\\\'s as if the parents are preparing the chicks for the temperature they will experience after hatching,\" said Dr Mariette.It is a mystery, she added, how being smaller gives the birds an advantage in the heat. But it may be because growing in hot conditions is costly for the body, placing more oxidative stress on tissues - so staying small becomes a better strategy.This could also help explain why, as global temperatures rise, wild bird populations in general Whatever their evolutionary implications, the Deakin team\\\'s findings are an intriguing case of communication between parents and unborn offspring.Nicola Hemmings, a research fellow studying bird reproduction at Sheffield University in the UK, said the experiments were elegantly designed and the results convincing.\"They\\\'ve shown that not only can parents teach their offspring a call while they\\\'re still in the egg - but that they\\\'re giving them quite specific information about the environment they\\\'re about to hatch into,\" she told the BBC.Just like the study\\\'s authors, Dr Hemmings said she was fascinated by what might be driving the changes in the chicks\\\' development.\"They\\\'re not actually thinking, \\\'Mum says it\\\'s hot out there, I better take it slow when I get outside!\\\' But it\\\'s having some kind of physiological effect on their body which is making their growth rate slow.\"Does it have a hormonal basis?

That extra matter builds up on the surface of the white dwarf until it kicks off a runaway, explosive thermonuclear reaction. Crucially, however, this blast only rips off the extra material; the white dwarf is left behind.\"The entire system survives the nova explosion... so the whole process starts again,\" said Mr Mr\\xc3\\xb3z. \"After thousands of years, our nova will awake and explode again but no one will be able to see it.\"This is in contrast to a Mr Mr\\xc3\\xb3z\\\'s key observations came from studying the light emitted by the system - which is an indication of the mass being stolen by the white dwarf - before and after its dramatic brightness spike in 2009.\"What we observed is that before the eruption, the mass transfer rate in the binary was very low and was unstable.

Industry sources say the study shows an association, not a cause and effect.In recent years, But few researchers have looked at the long term impacts of these substances.This new paper examined the impacts on populations of 62 species of wild bees across England over the period from 1994-2011. The team, from the They were able to compare the locations of these bees and their changing populations with growing patterns of oilseed rape across England over 18 years. The amount of this crop being sown has increased significantly over the period of the study, from around 500,000 hectares in 1994 to over 700,000 in 2011. A key innovation was the commercial licensing of neonicotinoid insecticides for the crop in the UK in 2002. Seeds are coated with the chemical and every part of the plant becomes toxic to pests. Manufacturers hailed the development as a major advance, reducing the need for leaf spraying with other insecticides. Around 85% of the oilseed rape crop in England now uses this method for pest protection.But this new work suggests, for the first time, that the detrimental impacts seen in the lab can be linked to large scale population extinctions of wild bees, especially for those species of bees that spend longer foraging on oilseed rape. \"The negative effects that have been reported previously do scale up to long-term, large-scale multi-species impacts that are harmful,\" said Dr Nick Isaac, a co-author of the new paper.\"Neonicotinoids are harmful, we can be very confident about that and our mean correlation is three times more negative for foragers than for non-foragers.\"There was a decline in the number of populations of 10%, attributable to neonicotinoids, across the 34 species that forage on oilseed rape. Five of the species showed declines of 20% or more, with the worst affected declining by 30%. Overall, half the total decline in wild bees could be linked to the chemicals. \"Historically, if you just have oilseed rape, many bees tend to benefit from that because it is this enormous foraging resource all over the countryside,\" said lead author Dr Ben Woodcock from the CEH.\"But this co-relation study suggests that once its treated with neonicotinoids up to 85%, then they are starting to be exposed and it\\\'s starting to have these detrimental impacts on them.\"\"What we can\\\'t say is what these detrimental impacts are but what it does suggest is you can have these population declines and they can be big - I mean 30% is a big decline.\" The authors acknowledge that their study finds an association and doesn\\\'t prove a cause and effect link between the use of neonicotinoids and the decline of bee populations. The manufacturers of the chemicals agree that it is an interesting statistical study, but they argue that intensive farming and not just a single insecticide might be the real cause of the decline. \"Since most of the oilseed rape grown in the UK was treated with a neonicotinoid seed treatment during the years that this study looked at, we believe its findings would be more correctly headlined that intensive agriculture is causing some issues with pollinators,\" said Dr Julian Little, from Bayer Crop Science in the UK.\"Whether this is due to the use of insecticides is not clear; a lack of nesting sites and pollen and nectar sources in these areas may also be critical factors.\"Other scientists, though, believe that the new study is some of the strongest data yet for the impact of these substances over the long term.\"This is the first good evidence that bees are affected at the population level by the widespread use of neonicotinoids,\" said Prof Henrik Smith from Lund University in Sweden, who was not involved with the research. \"It is the combination of evidence that is persuasive, that the effect depends on neonicotinoid exposure and affect species known to forage on oilseed rape more than other species.\" The European Food Safety Authority is currently conducting a review of the scientific evidence about neonicotinoids.

The scientists involved in the wild bee study caution against \"simplistic solutions\" to the problems of pollinators. They say a \"holistic\" approach to the use of insecticides must be taken and they are lukewarm about the idea of banning chemicals.\"When you grow oilseed rape you can\\\'t do it without pesticides, there\\\'s an underlying reality to this,\" said Dr Woodcock. \"Just because you say \\\'don\\\'t use neonicotinoids anymore\\\', the likelihood is that another pesticide is going to have to be used to compensate for that, that is going to have impacts on runoffs into waterways and on other species that you can control for.\"\"It needs to be taken in a very holistic perspective, you can\\\'t just say as long as we can save the bees everything else can go to hell, that\\\'s not where you want to be at.\"The Follow Matt on Twitter ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37089385','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-16 23:01:17',1),(139,'\'Industrial\' farms should lose subsidies','In its vision for the future of post-Brexit agriculture the Campaign to Protect Rural England says too much money is given to large-scale farms.','Large-scale \"industrial\" farms are receiving too much money in the form of EU subsidies, the Campaign to Protect Rural England has said.The claim is made in a publication by the charity which sets out a vision for the future of post-Brexit agriculture.The CPRE says these large-scale operations damage the environment and put smaller farmers out of business. To benefit countryside and rural communities, subsidies should instead go to smaller, more diverse farms.It also says land should be made available for new farmers to enter the market.Leaving the European Union means farmers will no longer receive EU subsidies under the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP).

The UK government has announced that it will match this funding until 2020.In its paper New Model Farming, the CPRE argues that in order to justify such huge state aid there needs to be a dramatic shift from giving money to what it calls \"industrial farms\". It says: \"New farmers and new small farms can kick-start an agricultural revolution.\"The paper claims some 80% of the CAP payment goes to the 20% largest businesses.It points out that populations of farmland birds have more than halved over the last 40 years.

So Hawking\\\'s idea relies on quantum mechanics - the realm of physics which takes hold at very small scales.These quantum effects allow black holes to radiate particles in a process which, over vast stretches of time, would ultimately cause the black hole to evaporate.But the amount of radiation emitted is small, so the phenomenon has never actually been observed in an astrophysical black hole.Prof Steinhauer, from the Technion - Israel Institute of Technology in Haifa, uncovered evidence that particles were spontaneously escaping his replica black hole.Furthermore, these were \"entangled\" (or linked) with partner particles being pulled into the hole - a key signature of Hawking radiation.The Bose-Einstein condensate used in the experiment is created when matter, in this case a cloud of rubidium atoms inside a tube, is cooled to near the temperature known as absolute zero, -273C. In this environment, sound travels at just half a millimetre per second. By speeding up the atoms partway along the tube, to faster than that speed, Prof Steinhauer created a sort of \"event horizon\" for sound waves.It was packets of sound waves, called \"phonons\", that played the part of entangled particles on the fringe of a black hole.The findings do not help answer one of the trickiest puzzles about black hole physics: the Information Paradox.One of the implications of Hawking\\\'s theory is that physical information - for example, about properties of a sub-atomic particle - is destroyed when black holes emit Hawking radiation.But this violates one of the rules of quantum theory.Toby Wiseman, a theoretical physicist at Imperial College London, told BBC News: \"Analogues are very interesting from an experimental and technological point of view. But I don\\\'t think we\\\'re ever going to learn anything about actual black holes [from these simulations]. What it is doing is confirming the ideas of Hawking, but in this analogue setting.\"Dr Wiseman, who was not involved with the research, compared idea of the Bose-Einstein condensate simulation to water in a bathtub.\"It relies on the fact that there\\\'s a precise mathematical analogue between the physics of particles near black holes and ripples in flowing fluids... It\\\'s an elegant idea that goes back some way.\"If you pull the plug in a bath, you create a flow down the plug, and the ripples on the the water get dragged down the plughole. The flow gets quicker as it gets toward the plughole and if you have a system where the flow is going faster than the speed of the ripples, when those ripples flow past some point near the plughole, they can never come back out.\"Dr Wiseman said this point was equivalent to the event horizon - the point of no return for matter being drawn in by the gravity of a black hole.Follow Paul ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37088877','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-16 17:25:06',1),(141,'Viruses \'more dangerous in the morning\'','Viruses are more dangerous when they infect their victims in the morning, a University of Cambridge study suggests.','Viruses are more dangerous when they infect their victims in the morning, a University of Cambridge study suggests. The findings, And the animal studies found that a disrupted body clock - caused by shift-work or jet lag - was always vulnerable to infection. The researchers say the findings could lead to new ways of stopping pandemics. Viruses - unlike bacteria or parasites - are completely dependent on hijacking the machinery inside cells in order to replicate. But those cells change dramatically as part of a 24-hour pattern known as the body clock.In the study, mice were infected with either influenza, which causes flu, or herpes virus, which can cause a range of diseases including cold sores.  The mice infected in the morning had 10 times the viral levels of those infected in the evening. The late viruses were failing after essentially trying to hijack a factory after all the workers had gone home.Prof Akhilesh Reddy, one of the researchers, told the BBC News website: \"It\\\'s a big difference.\"The virus needs all the apparatus available at the right time, otherwise it might not ever get off the ground, but a tiny infection in the morning might perpetuate faster and take over the body.\" He believes the findings could help control outbreaks of disease. Prof Reddy said: \"In a pandemic, staying in during the daytime could be quite important and save people\\\'s lives, it could have a big impact if trials bear it out.\" Further tests showed that disrupting the animal\\\'s body clock meant they were \"locked in\" to a state that allowed the viruses to thrive. Dr Rachel Edgar, the first author, said: \"This indicates that shift workers, who work some nights and rest some nights and so have a disrupted body clock, will be more susceptible to viral diseases.\"If so, then they could be prime candidates for receiving the annual flu vaccines.\"The researchers used only two viruses in the study. However, the pair were very distinct (one was a DNA virus the other an RNA virus), which leads the research team to suspect the morning risk may be a broad principle that applies across a wide number of viruses. About 10% of genes, the instructions for running the human body, change activity throughout the day, and this is controlled by the internal clock.The research focused on one clock gene called Bmal1, which has its peak activity in the afternoon in both mice and people. Prof Reddy added: \"It\\\'s the link with Bmal1 that\\\'s important, since when that\\\'s low (in the early morning), you\\\'re more susceptible to infection.\"Curiously, Bmal1 becomes less active in people during the winter months - suggesting it may have a role in the greater risk of infections at that time of the year.The body clock has been implicated in our susceptibility to infections before, Follow James ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-36782326','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-16 07:35:39',1),(142,'Culham Science Centre nuclear experts fear quarry dust','Scientists carrying out international nuclear fusion work are concerned dust from a planned quarry could affect their experiments.','Scientists are concerned dust from a planned quarry could affect their nuclear fusion experiments.Hills Quarry Products The Culham Science Centre (CSC), which is close to the site near Clifton Hampden and home to the UK Atomic Energy Authority, has objected.It added: \"The environmental impact assessment submitted by the applicant completely fails to recognise the importance of CSC, and hence also completely fails to assess the impact that the quarry might have on the site.\"The site is also home to the Joint European Torus, which experiments with fusion, with an aim to create clean, almost limitless energy.A spokesman at the centre said: \"Our main concern is that Hills Quarry Products have not provided sufficient evidence on the impact of dust from the proposed quarry on operations at the Culham site. \"We have raised this in our submission to Oxfordshire County Council and trust that the planning process will ensure our concerns are addressed.South Oxfordshire District Council urged Oxfordshire County Council to take account of a \"Giles Baxter, from campaign group Burcot and Clifton Hampden Protection of the River Thames (Bachport), said: \"The fears expressed by Culham and the Environment Agency come on top of the strong opposition from local villages.

A dozen of the hairy brown animals were brought back by a zoo keeper in 2013, after observing them in the wild on multiple field trips.Three years later, after much study and behavioural management, one female has produced 200 British-born baby spiders.\"It\\\'s kind of a race against time, whether you can synchronise the sexual maturity between individuals,\" said Chester Zoo\\\'s curator of lower vertebrates, Gerardo Garcia.Part of the problem is that male Montserrat tarantulas live for about 2.5 years at the most, whereas the females live much longer and develop much more slowly. The few males Dr Garcia had collected, therefore, were a precious resource. There were nervous moments for the team when they started match-making.As with many other invertebrates, those encounters were risky for the males.\"The female can take it as a prey, rather than a partner,\" Dr Garcia told the BBC. \"There were a lot of sweaty moments.\"He and his colleagues observed a very tentative courtship ritual, in which the male drums out an elaborate rhythm on the female\\\'s web - which is spun on the ground near her burrow.Even after three apparently successful encounters, there was another anxious wait for Dr Garcia. All three pregnant females disappeared.\"They literally dig a burrow in the ground, and they\\\'re gone,\" he said. \"They don\\\'t feed, they don\\\'t show up, we don\\\'t know what\\\'s going on. You just have to leave it for several months and see what happens.\"Then eventually... spiders started popping out of the earth like crazy. From one single burrow, one female, we had about 200 tarantulas - tiny spiderlings.\"Those babies - the first spiderlings of their species to be observed by scientists - are now being very well looked after.\"We\\\'re keeping them in small, individual pots,\" Dr Garcia said. \"A member of staff is feeding them one-by-one with small flies, at the beginning. Then we\\\'ll go for bigger prey like crickets.\"In a year or two, these spiders will in turn become part of the breeding program. After all, there are no males left in the small colony of adults; they die after mating.Being able to see the tarantula\\\'s complete life cycle is valuable, Dr Garcia explained, because there is much to learn about these animals.\"We don\\\'t know too much about tarantulas in general, in the Caribbean. It\\\'s a taxonomic group that\\\'s very uncertain.\"In fact, the Montserrat species has only been formally described on the basis of a single, male specimen, collected 100 years ago. \"At the moment we\\\'re working with a specialist at the Natural History Museum to describe the other sex, the female.\" It was that lack of knowledge that led Dr Garcia to collect some wild adults on a conference trip to Montserrat three years ago.He became interested in the tarantulas on a previous field trip, when he and a team of other zoologists made a striking observation: these 15-20cm spiders are a prey item for the Caribbean\\\'s famous - and critically endangered - These very large frogs had been known to eat crickets, millipedes, smaller frogs and lizard, and even bats.

The Perseid meteor shower is caused by a trail of debris from a comet called Swift-Tuttle which orbits the Sun. Every year between July and August, the Earth drifts into the belt of material left by Swift-Tuttle and is peppered with meteors, which burn up as they hit the atmosphere creating streaks of light. These meteors are called the Perseids, because they appear to be coming from the constellation But this year is unusual according to astronomers, as the Earth moved through a particularly distinct bit of debris a day earlier than normal. This clump of material has been nudged into the Earth\\\'s path by Jupiter\\\'s gravity.

The Lead author Julius Nielsen, a marine biologist from the The former vertebrate record-holder was a bowhead whale estimated to be 211 years old. But if invertebrates are brought into the longevity competition, a Greenland sharks are huge beasts, that can grow up to 5m in length.They can be found, swimming slowly, throughout the cold, deep waters of the North Atlantic.With this leisurely pace of life and sluggish growth rate, the sharks were thought to live for a long time.  But until now, determining any ages was difficult.For some fish, scientists are able to examine ear bones called otoliths, which when sectioned, show a pattern of concentric rings that scientists can count as they would the rings in a tree.Sharks are harder, but some species, such as the Great White, have calcified tissue that grows in layers on their back bones, that can also be used to age the animals.\"But the Greenland shark is a very, very soft shark - it has no hard body parts where growth layers are deposited. So it was believed that the age could not be investigated,\" Mr Nielsen told the BBC.However the team found a clever way of working out the age. \"The Greenland shark\\\'s eye lens is composed of a specialised material - and it contains proteins that are metabolically inert,\" explained Mr Neilson.\"Which means after the proteins have been synthesised in the body, they are not renewed any more.  So we can isolate the tissue that formed when the shark was a pup, and do radiocarbon dating.\"The team looked at 28 sharks, most of which had died after being caught in fishing nets as by-catch. Using this technique, they established that the largest shark - a 5m-long female - was extremely ancient.Because radiocarbon dating does not produce exact dates, they believe that she could have been as \"young\" as 272 or as old as 512. But she was most likely somewhere in the middle, so about 400 years old. It means she was born between the years of 1501 and 1744, but her most likely date of birth was in the 17th century.\"Even with the lowest part of this uncertainty, 272 years, even if that is the maximum age, it should still be considered the longest-living vertebrate,\" said Mr Nielsen.Conversely, if her age is at the upper end of the scale, she will have out-lived Ming the clam - although her age has a greater probability of lying in the middle.The team believes the animals only reach sexual maturity when they are 4m-long. And with this new, very lengthy age-range, it suggests this does not occur until the animals are about 150 years old.The researchers say this has consequences for future conservation of the animals. Because of their extreme longevity, Greenland sharks may still be recovering from being over-fished before WW2.  The sharks\\\' livers were once used for machine oil, and they were killed in great numbers before a synthetic alternative was found and the demand fell. \"When you evaluate the size distribution all over the North Atlantic, it is quite rare that you see sexually mature females, and quite rare that you find newborn pups or juveniles,\" Mr Nielsen explained. \"It seems most are sub-adults. That makes sense: if you have had this very high fishing pressure, all the old animals - they are not there any more.

This translated into better bowel and bladder functions - which are very critical for these patients.\" As well as intensive use of the non-invasive \"brain-machine interface\", the training incorporated two more established physiotherapy techniques based on assisted walking in a harness.Other spinal repair experts said it was unclear which part of the training was responsible for the improvement, but that the degree of recovery was impressive compared with many other rehabilitation strategies.\"It clearly shows that there\\\'s a lot of untapped neuroplasticity potential within even a chronic spinal cord injury patient,\" said Dr Mark Bacon, chief executive and scientific director of the UK charity \"But there\\\'s no control group - so you don\\\'t really know which combination of elements that they\\\'ve applied\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 might be the major contributor.\"With just eight patients and no comparison with other treatments, the study is not a clinical trial. In fact, the researchers themselves were not expecting to see the patients improve in this way. When the study began, their aim was not to restore spinal cord function but to test whether paralysed people could learn to walk again with the aid of a brain-controlled exoskeleton.This remarkable system, pioneered by Prof Nicolelis and Information from electronic sensors on those robotic legs - such as when they touch the ground - is then fed back to the person, via vibrating pads worn in their sleeves.\"We use the arms of these patients as transducers, for the brain to perceive signals coming from the feet,\" said Prof Nicolelis.\"If you adjust these parameters just right, what you produce is some sort of phantom limb sensation. They patients have a feeling that they\\\'re walking by themselves.\"He argues that this retraining of the brain is central to the patients\\\' unexpected neurological progress, outside the exoskeleton.\"In virtually every one of these patients, the brain had erased the notion of having legs. You\\\'re paralysed, you\\\'re not moving, the legs are not providing feedback signals.\"By using a brain-machine interface in a virtual environment, we were able to see this concept gradually re-emerging into the brain.\"The team intended to use that re-awakened control to drive the robotic legs - but within 12 months they saw such improvement in basic clinical scores that four of the eight patients were upgraded to a diagnosis of only partial paraplegia.\"When I saw this, I couldn\\\'t believe it,\" said Prof Nicolelis. He believes the improvement arises from not only increased effort by the brain to control the legs, but a \"rekindling\" of the few remaining nerve connections in the patients\\\' damaged spines.As those few fibres start to send messages again, Prof Nicolelis speculated that there may even be some fresh sprouting of nerves.But the only evidence his team has to work with is the patients\\\' clinical improvement.That improvement, he added,  has continued since the 12 months covered by the paper, which were back in 2014. These more recent results are not yet published.Dr Bacon from Spinal Research commented that although the results were difficult to interpret, they were promising.\"They\\\'ve taken chronic, what would be considered neurologically stable patients - so the expectation would be that they wouldn\\\'t change with time - and they\\\'ve recorded some sensory and motor changes in each of those patients, which is pretty impressive,\" he said.James Fawcett, of the Cambridge Centre for Brain Repair, also said the study was noteworthy.\"There\\\'s a lot of interest at the moment in how to make rehabilitation work better,\" he told the BBC. \"Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn\\\'t.\"In this case, the regime worked better than most walking-based rehabilitation efforts; but more work was required, Prof Fawcett said, to unpick exactly what had happened.\"Some patients do get better anyway. And when you treat them very intensively, there\\\'s a huge placebo effect.\"This is a basket of manipulations. But in a sense, they all fit together.\"It\\\'s an important step forward.\"Follow Jonathan ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37024197','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-11 21:54:38',1),(149,'HMT Arfon: Sunken WWI mine trawler protected','The sunken wreck of a fishing trawler that swept for mines during World War One is given special protection by Historic England.','The sunken wreck of a fishing trawler that swept for mines during World War One has been given special protection.The steam boat Arfon had remained untouched on the bed of the English Channel for almost 100 years until it was discovered in 2014.The trawler swept mines laid by German U-boats off the Dorset coast until 10 of its 13 crew members died when it struck a mine in April 1917.The new protection restricts access to the site.Historic England said the trawler\\\'s mine-sweeping gear, deck gun and engine room were still intact on the seabed off St Alban\\\'s Head.But the government heritage agency feared the Arfon, built in Goole, East Yorkshire, in 1908, could be vulnerable to uncontrolled salvage.The Department for Culture, Media and Sport granted it protection under the Protection of Wrecks Act 1973, which means access to the site is restricted to divers with a licence from Historic England.Joe Flatman, the body\\\'s head of listing programmes, said: \"The Arfon shipwreck is a rare survivor of a type of vessel once very common around the coastline of Britain but which has now entirely disappeared, surviving only in documents and as wrecks like this one.\"Trawlers, minesweepers and other coastal patrol vessels played a crucial role in keeping the sea lanes around the British Isles open during both world wars, a part of the war effort that is often overlooked.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-dorset-37117334','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-19 07:19:02',1),(150,'The top-secret tortoise sanctuary of Madagascar','Madagascar\'s conservationists work in secrecy to protect one of the world\'s most beautiful tortoises from poachers, writes journalist Martin Vogl.','Madagascar\\\'s conservationists are working in secrecy to protect one of the world\\\'s most beautiful tortoises from poachers, writes journalist Martin Vogl.   The villa on the outskirts of Madagascar\\\'s capital, Antananarivo, has no sign to indicate what goes on there. There is barbed wire on the walls and dogs patrol at night. The staff do not talk much to outsiders about what they do, and I promised not to give away any more about the location, other than to say that it is somewhere near the airport in the north of the city.The secrecy and security is due to the fact that the villa is the headquarters of the Turtle Survival Alliance (TSA) and just next to the main building in small pens made from wood are more than 500 radiated tortoises. It is these tortoises that need protecting. They are worth a lot of money. They were going to be smuggled out of Madagascar when they were seized by officials and handed over to the TSA. If the tortoises had made it to the international black market they could have been sold for around $800 (\\xc2\\xa3600) each.  Radiated tortoises are sought after by collectors around the world, in part because of their stunning shells. The name \"radiated\" refers to the black and yellow star-like pattern on their backs.The TSA received around 3,000 radiated tortoises seized by Madagascar\\\'s authorities in 2015.Although TSA staff are pleased the tortoises were found, the numbers they are being asked to look after are straining the non-governmental organisation\\\'s resources and diverting them from what they see as their main job.\"The main thing we do is to save the species where they are, in their natural habitat, working with the community,\" says Herilala Randriamahazo, TSA\\\'s Madagascar coordinator.Mr Randriamahazo says TSA would much rather be doing this than acting as a tortoise rescue centre. Caring for hundreds of tortoises presents all sorts of logistical and financial problems.It is difficult to find the right medical care for the animals which often arrive in a very poor state, having spent days or weeks hidden in baggage without food or water. They need de-worming and sometimes antibiotics. Feeding them greens is also expensive as they have a big appetite.\"Even in the market, we can\\\'t find the amount of food that we\\\'d like to buy in order to feed these animals properly,\" Mr Randriamahazo says.All this care is not for a short period. TSA keeps most young tortoises for at least five years so that when they are released back in the wild their shells are strong enough and they are not at risk of being eaten by wild dogs.Liva Ramiandrarivo, the director-general of forests at Madagascar\\\'s Environment Ministry, knows the pressure that organisations like the TSA are under.He says tortoise trafficking is a serious concern for the government, but admits that efforts to stop it have often been compromised because of a lack of coordination between government departments.\"It\\\'s not just a job for the Ministry of the Environment, Ecology and the Sea. It should also involve the other sectors - for example the Justice Ministry, the security services,\" he says. According to Mr Ramiandrarivo, the issue of coordination is being addressed, but even once this is resolved corruption will remain a problem. He says some officials help directly with the smuggling - sometimes loading hundreds of tortoises straight onto planes without going through customs. They are usually hidden in personal luggage or freight and are wrapped up in plastic bags, clothes or even nappies.Other officials, he says, can be bribed by traffickers if they get caught.Miguel Pedrono, a French expert on tortoise conservation in Madagascar, says all the money used to look after the tortoises would be much better used to fight poaching.\"Radiated tortoises which have been seized, be they tortoises found by customs at the airport here, or ones found overseas, are definitively lost, as far as the species is concerned,\" he says.He suggests that the tortoises could be given away to zoos. Alternatively, he says they should at least be released into areas where there are no radiated tortoise populations.This, he says, would minimise the risks of introducing diseases in existing populations and reduce the risk to genetic diversity. At the moment, the TSA releases the tortoises into areas where there are already tortoise populations. Mr Randriamahazo says the TSA is already overwhelmed and it does not have the resources to do much more. For now, he is simply preparing the TSA villa to look after more seized tortoises.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-37035238','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-16 09:03:45',1),(151,'Snail \'Swat teams\'','Australian researchers are investigating if the scent of giant sea snails could help repel millions of coral-eating starfish from the Great Barrier Reef.','A giant sea snail could be the answer to getting rid of coral-eating starfish from the Great Barrier Reef, Myles Gough reports. Australian researchers are investigating whether the scent of a natural predator can help repel millions of crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS) from corals on the Great Barrier Reef.Crown-of-thorns starfish (Acanthaster planci) are native to reefs in the Indian and Pacific Oceans, but are one of the largest threats to corals outside of cyclones.  These animals, which are covered in hundreds of venomous spikes, feed on the flesh of corals until all that\\\'s left is a calcium carbonate skeleton. Between 1985 and 2012, they were responsible for 42% of all lost coral cover in Australia. What makes the starfish so devastating is that they are prone to population explosions.\"It\\\'s a species a bit like locusts,\" says Dr Mike Hall, a marine biologist at the Australian Institute of Marine Science. \"They\\\'re always around somewhere at low numbers, but every now and then there are large outbreaks.\" An outbreak in 2015 resulted in an estimated 7 million COTS living and feeding on corals throughout the Great Barrier Reef. Just one animal can eat about 10sqm (110sq feet) of coral in a year, and this tissue never grows back, Dr Hall says.  At present, the best way to manage these outbreaks is by killing individual starfish one-by-one with lethal injections, which are administered by divers. \"On small local scales, this can protect reefs of high eco-tourism value,\" Dr Hall says. \"But trying to do it on a whole Great Barrier Reef scale - it would be like a military campaign. You\\\'d have to put a lot more soldiers out there on the reefs, injecting away.\" It\\\'s simply too costly.  But with more outbreaks likely in future, and corals under increasing stress from climate change and bleaching events, better management strategies are needed. Hall\\\'s outside-the-box solution is to use the Pacific triton (Charonia tritonis), a large sea snail known for its beautifully coloured shell. The Pacific triton is one of the only natural predators of COTS. Native to the same habitats in the Indo-Pacific region, But Dr Hall\\\'s not interested in their appetite. Instead, he wants to harness the chemical scent these snails send out into the marine environment to manipulate the behaviour of COTS. His team has already demonstrated that COTS can detect the presence of a triton: \"They rapidly try to get out of the way and go into hiding to avoid being eaten,\" he says.  \"In a terrestrial environment, a farmer might use a scarecrow,\" Dr Hall says. \"In the marine environment, the same thing works by smell.\" He\\\'s hoping to trick the COTS into fleeing their coral settlements.  Pacific tritons could be farmed and released onto reefs like \"Swat teams\" to drive an exodus of COTS, Dr Hall says. As they are slow-moving and colourful, they could later be collected and re-deployed elsewhere.  This might avoid the collateral damage of leaving the snails there permanently to eat other organisms, such as sea cucumbers.    Dr Hall\\\'s ultimate goal, however, is to identify, isolate and synthesise the fear-inducing chemical compound that\\\'s released by the triton in order to develop slow-dissolving capsules. The scent would linger and create the illusion of tritons being present on the reef. Although these solutions wouldn\\\'t kill the starfish, Hall believes they could disrupt their breeding habits enough to \"potentially break the outbreak cycle\". \"They would be in panicked, alarmed state rather than concentrating on being close to each other and spawning,\" he says.  His team is also trying to understand the chemical signals released by the COTS themselves, including one that apparently causes the animals to cluster together. If this scent could be manufactured, Hall says it could be used to force them into one location, where they could more easily be culled or collected in a trap. Dr Jon Brodie, chief research scientist at the Centre for Tropical Water and Aquatic Ecosystems Research at James Cook University, says we need a new management strategy for controlling the coral-destroying starfish.\"Manually killing tens of thousands of crown-of-thorns starfish each year simply can\\\'t have an effect on an entire population of up to 10 million.\" Dr Brodie says it\\\'s \"highly unlikely\" that the chemical scent of tritons will be an effective deterrent for COTS but he says all options should be considered: \"I think it\\\'s a far-fetched solution, but times are desperate for the Great Barrier Reef,\" he says. \"It\\\'s in terrible shape.\" \"I\\\'m not against spending more money to investigate the option because it might just work.\" Dr Brodie says there also needs to be more focus on managing water quality, including nutrient runoff from farms, which is believed to cause COTS outbreaks.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-37091400','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-18 23:06:10',1),(152,'Pump action','Lonnie Johnson had an illustrious career as a nuclear engineer working on the Galileo space programme and the stealth bomber - but he is best known for creating a water pistol','Lonnie Johnson was brought up in Mobile, Alabama in the 1960s, when black children were not expected to go far, but such was his talent for engineering that he worked for Nasa, and helped test the first stealth bomber. But as he explains here, the invention that made his fortune was a water pistol - the extremely powerful Super Soaker.I\\\'ve always liked to tinker with things. It started with my dad. He gave me my first lesson in electricity, explaining that it takes two wires for electric current to flow - one for the electrons to go in, the other for them to come out. And he showed me how to repair irons and lamps and things like that.The kids in the neighbourhood took to calling me \"the Professor\". We had little projects that we would work on, and I was the ringleader.For example, I put together a working engine out of parts from a scrapyard, and we stuck that engine on one of our go-karts. It had thin wagon wheels instead of tyres, and the hood was just a crate. You controlled the steering with a piece of string. It was not perfect. We had to push the car to get it going, but after that it could sustain itself. And we had a lot of fun with it - though we were stopped by the police, because the vehicle was not exactly street-legal.About three years later I was stopped a second time, when I was cycling around with some sheet metal on the back of my bicycle.I was scared, but the police officer just wanted to know what the heck I was up to. So he escorted me home and I showed him how I was making a robot just like the ones I saw on TV. Nobody had told me that the robots I saw on shows like Lost In Space had actors inside them!This project took almost a whole year, my last year of high school.  But finally the robot was finished and we entered him into a fair held by the Junior Engineering Technical Society at the University of Alabama.We were the only black school there. This was 1968, just five years after Governor Wallace had stood in the doorway of the Foster Auditorium to attempt to block the enrolment of two black students - and my high school was in the news a lot because they were integrating us. White people were coming on TV, calling us all kinds of names, and saying they didn\\\'t want their kids coming to the school and being exposed to us.It was all just curious to me. I have never really understood why in this country so many people look down on black people. I can\\\'t say it weighed on me at the time, though. I was just so excited to have my robot, to know that it worked and that I would have a chance to show it off. The robot was called Linex. He was three-and-a-half-feet (1m) tall, had shoulders that could rotate and two arms with elbows and wrists that swivelled. He could pivot and move around on wheels. His chest contained a propane tank that I\\\'d filled with compressed air to move the limbs. His memory was a reel-to-reel tape recorder, which I\\\'d linked to a remote-control unit improvised from my sister\\\'s walkie-talkie. Linex was controlled by signals transmitted through this unit. When you turned the tape recorder on it recorded different frequencies and tones, like the noises you get when you press the buttons on a telephone. Then it would play back and the robot would follow all the instructions.Well, I\\\'m not sure if it\\\'s because the judges at the science fair were from out of town, or if it\\\'s because they were from industry, not the university, but in any case they awarded me and Linex first place.Looking back, I am struck by the University of Alabama\\\'s lack of curiosity about me. You would have thought they would want to know, \"Who is this guy? What kind of grades does he have? Is he qualified to attend school here?\" But those overtures were not made to me.Instead, I got an Air Force scholarship and a math scholarship to Tuskegee University, a black school that\\\'s famous for the Tuskegee Airmen. During WWII there was an experiment to see if blacks could fly aeroplanes and the Tuskegee Airmen went on to become so successful as a fighter squadron escorting bombers that pilots would request them by name.  I received a bachelor\\\'s degree in mechanical engineering, then graduated with a masters in nuclear engineering.In one of my first jobs, at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, I found myself working on cooling systems for nuclear reactors with an engineer who had graduated from a prestigious New England university. To my surprise I found I just knew how to do things he didn\\\'t know how to do. I had been exposed to things he hadn\\\'t been exposed to and I was able to solve problems more easily.  I was struck by how well Tuskegee had prepared me to be an engineer.  I thought, \"Here I am going toe-to-toe with an engineer from one of the top schools in the country.\"In 1975, I was called to active duty in the Air Force, studying US space launches that used nuclear power. I felt it was a big deal to be involved in such an important project - we were providing technical support for launch recommendations that ultimately went to the president. After I presented an analysis that identified a possible failure Nasa had overlooked, I was invited on to the Galileo Mission, the unmanned spacecraft sent to study Jupiter and its moons. I was given responsibility for attaching the nuclear power source to the spacecraft and allocating power to the various systems - the science instruments, the computer, the power control system. A major concern was that in the event of a short circuit, power to the memory would be lost and the spacecraft would be unable to call home. So I devised an isolation circuit that would maintain power to the computer memories even when power was lost.So in 1982 you could say that I had a fun day job working on these spacecraft in Pasadena, California, but all this time I continued to tinker on my own ideas in the evening.At that time I was experimenting with a new type of refrigeration system that would use water as a working fluid instead of ozone-destroying CFCs. One evening, I machined a nozzle and hooked it up to the bathroom sink, where I was performing some experiments. It shot a powerful stream of water across the bathroom sink. That\\\'s when I got the idea that a powerful water gun would be fun! But it was months before I did anything about it.I rejoined the Air Force and relocated with my family to a military base in Omaha, Nebraska. I went on to become the first engineer from the Strategic Air Command - which had responsibility for identifying nuclear targets - assigned to test the B-2 Bomber, the Stealth Bomber.After I had settled into my new job and home, I set to work making the parts of the plastic water gun on a little lathe and milling machine in the basement. I really had no idea if the magic I had in mind was going to materialise until all the parts were put together and I was ready to pull the trigger. I gave the plastic gun to my seven-year-old daughter, Aneka, and watched as she used it to play with the other kids on the airbase. They couldn\\\'t even get close to her with their little squirt guns. I soon found my prototype water pistol was an excellent ice-breaker at social events. I took it to an Air Force picnic one day and a superior officer, a major, saw it and said, \"What is that you got, Johnson?\" I said, \"This is my water gun, sir.\" And he said, \"It looks really strange - does it work?\"So I turned to him and shot him right between the eyes. After that, the picnic was over. Everybody was throwing cups of water, cups of beer and it just turned into a big free-for-all.My initial idea was to manufacture the gun myself. A factory told me it would cost $200,000 to get the first 1,000 guns off the production line. Well, I didn\\\'t have $200,000, so I realised I would have to go into a strategic partnership with a toy company.There followed seven years of frustration and false starts. I don\\\'t know what it is with me, but I\\\'ve never been very good at giving up.Then, in February 1989 I was walking the halls of the American International Toy Fair in New York, the world\\\'s largest toy fair, when I ran into a company called Larami.  At the time, they were knock-off merchants - they would look at what the major toy companies were making, and what had TV advertising, then they would make cheap copies and grab 10% of the market.At the toy fair, the vice president, a guy called Al Davis, told me that the idea of a really high-performance water pistol was interesting. \"I can\\\'t really review a product here,\" he told me, \"but if you\\\'re ever in Philadelphia, where our headquarters are, I\\\'d be happy to talk to you. Drop in and see us.\"So I said, \"Ok, great.\" But just as I was turning to leave, he called after me and said, \"By the way - don\\\'t make a special trip.\"Despite these discouraging words, as soon as I got home I started work on a fresh prototype of the water gun. The new test model was made of plexiglass and PVC piping, and incorporated a new design feature - instead of keeping water inside the gun itself, a two-litre soda bottle sat on the top, and acted as a water reservoir.It was 628mm long. The diameter of the water stream was 2.4mm and could reach more than 12 metres.   It took me a couple of weeks to build the model, then I called Larami and said, \"It just happens that I\\\'m going to be in your area soon\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\"I remember sitting in their conference room with the president and vice-president of the company and some marketing people. I opened my suitcase, took the gun out and shot it across the conference room. And they said: \"Wow!\"I knew that I had captured their imagination. But we had the challenge of commercialisation. This gun was more complicated than the squirt guns that were on the market, and it took a lot of work to bring the price down to $10. Even then, we weren\\\'t sure that anyone would pay anywhere near that amount for a water pistol.In 1990, the gun appeared in the toy shops. It was called the Power Drencher. To begin with we didn\\\'t do any marketing or TV advertising - but it still sold well.The following year, we rebranded the toy the Super Soaker and did a big push on TV. That was the summer we sold 20 million guns, and I remember just staring at my royalties cheque in disbelief.It seems strange now, but back in 1992, the Super Soaker was quite controversial. There were a few tragic incidents - on one occasion some kids shot someone with a Super Soaker, and he shot back with a real gun. On another occasion, a water fight in Boston escalated into a real gun fight and a teenager was killed. There were also reports of people using them in weird ways, for example filling them with bleach instead of water.The mayor of Boston tried to introduce a voluntary sales ban on the toys. I got a phone call from a reporter from that city, who, in the most serious and grave voice told me, \"We\\\'ve got a report that Super Soakers are being used in drive-by shootings, and we were wondering if you had any comment.\"I had no idea what to say to him. In the end, I said, \"Well\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 you know\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I think we should have more of that.\"In the back of my mind, I felt that my work on toy guns was probably less harmful than the work I did on real weapons systems.Further generations of Super Soakers followed, and I went on to design the N-Strike range of Nerf dart guns, which used some of the same compressed air technology. Being a toy that sells year-round, I made even more money through Nerf guns than I had with the Super Soaker.I didn\\\'t buy a yacht or anything. I\\\'ve spent the money on something much more interesting - to me, anyway.I have built a scientific facility in Atlanta, Georgia, which has about 30 staff.For more than 20 years I have been interested in battery technology. Batteries typically contain liquid, but we have developed an all-ceramic battery which uses glass as an electrolyte.It can hold three times as much charge as a lithium ion battery and it is stable enough that it can be used in very harsh environments, such as oil wells. It can be bulk-manufactured in a similar way to ceramic plates.We are also working on an engine which is the great, great-grandson of the cooling system I was working on in 1982 when I hit upon the idea of the Super Soaker. The Johnson Thermo-Electrochemical Converter (J-TEC) is a very efficient engine that uses hydrogen to convert heat directly into electricity and it has no moving mechanical parts.When I look at a problem I have an intuition about whether or not it can be solved, but that isn\\\'t good enough for most investors. The process of invention requires breakthroughs and you can\\\'t predict when those will happen. So it\\\'s really only thanks to the Super Soaker and Nerf guns that I have been able to develop the ceramic battery and the J-TEC.At our offices we have a lot of the toys kicking around and every now and then we do play with them.I also take the guns into schools to give talks. Kids need exposure to ideas, and they need to be given an opportunity to experience success. Once you get that feeling, it grows and feeds itself - but some kids have got to overcome their environments and attitudes that have been imposed on them.In spite of the things that have been perpetrated on my race - holding us in bondage under slavery, then making it illegal to educate us and then subjecting us to long-term discrimination and criticism - we succeed anyway, to a very large extent. We just need to realise what we\\\'re capable of.More than 170 Super Soaker models were launched, and they have made more than $1bn (\\xc2\\xa3760m). For a while I tried to buy every toy that contained one of my patents, but I couldn\\\'t keep up.After I\\\'m finished with all this hard science stuff, I\\\'m looking forward to doing some more straightforward inventing. Stuff where it\\\'s easier to make a bit of money. I have a few ideas in mind - not toys, just consumer products that I know will be easy to manufacture and that will sell well.But I hope you don\\\'t mind if I keep them to myself for now.As told to ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37062579','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-16 06:05:15',1),(153,'Crowd dynamics','The World Music Festival, Womad, hosted a science pavilion this year, but are such initiatives successful?','The World Music Festival, Womad, hosted a science pavilion this year.

His words came back to me as I watched a technician at the Bristol brain bank carefully dissect one of the facility\\\'s freshly donated specimens.The intricate folds and switchbacks of its surface and its delicate branching structures, revealed by her cuts, were entrancing. They seem only faintly to echo the complexity and power that tissue had held in life.The brain being methodically portioned up for storage was one of around 40 donations the South West Dementia Brain Bank receives each year. This bank in Bristol is one of 10 centres that make up the Between them annually they supply tens of thousands of samples of research tissue to scientists in the UK and abroad.One of the thousand brains already fixed and frozen in the store rooms at Bristol is that of Angela Carlson.Written into that 3lb (1.4kg) of dissected tissue are the experiences, memories and knowledge of a very adventurous woman, for her time. She spent her teens in the land army during World War Two, followed by stints as a cook and child minder in the USA, and in what was then Persia.Twice widowed and without children, she eventually settled in Dorset to be near her niece Susan Jonas. She died there from dementia, aged 89.Susan recalls the heartbreak of watching the spirited aunt she loved lose her mental faculties in her eighties.\"She had a bit of paranoia as part of her dementia. She thought men were coming into her bedroom at night and we would get calls from the police, telling us she had called them reporting intruders. She was on their special list.\"When we cleared out her house we found goodness knows how many weapons under her bed, from hammers to an assegai - a kind of African spear! She was a tiny woman, she could never have used them.\"Angela had stated in her will that she wanted to leave her body to medical research. As executor of Angela\\\'s estate, Susan decided that given her aunt\\\'s dementia, the best way to honour that wish was to donate her brain. Susan signed up her aunt before she died.\"She was a lovely lady who always wanted to help others, so I felt I was carrying on her mantle by donating her brain. What she had done in life she could continue to do in death.\"Angela\\\'s brain is one of 14,000 donations held by the UK Brain Bank Network. The network\\\'s director, Prof Seth Love, has no doubt about the important role these brains have played in scientific discovery.\"Most understanding of human neurological disease has come from examining human brain tissue and most of the advances in neurological disease have occurred really within the last 2-3 decades - mostly from examination of brains derived from brain banks,\" he said.Search the records of scientific discovery and the contribution of such stores of material is clear.From Arvid Carlsson\\\'s discovery in 1957 that the loss of dopamine-producing nerve cells causes Parkinson\\\'s disease, to James Ironside\\\'s identification in 1996 of a new strain of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (CJD) that was linked to BSE - post-mortem brain tissue was vital.And scientists like 42-year-old Dr Tammaryn Lashley - a dementia researcher at University College London - are just as convinced of the continuing importance of the \"real thing\". \"Scans don\\\'t take you down to the cellular level; they don\\\'t tell you what happened to the brain cells in the dementia process. We really need to be able to look at brain material under the microscope to determine where and what has gone wrong.\" The method of preservation has evolved since the first banks in the 1950s. Then, tissue was fixed in chemicals such as formalin. That process is still used today for one half of the brain, to give it stiffness so it can be sliced very thinly and viewed under the microscope.But the other half is cut up whilst fresh and frozen at -80C to allow analysis of genetic material, proteins and neurochemicals that can tell researchers much more about the development of disease.Organisations such as Just as important are brains from healthy donors, so that researchers have non-diseased tissue samples for comparison. Retired teacher Margaret Allan from Reading is one such candidate. She recently registered with the Queen\\\'s Square Brain Bank in London.As one of the remaining members of the Her lifetime experience of lending her body and mind to medical research made this final act of altruism a logical choice.\"That research has been used to influence social policy. A lot of things we take for granted were a result of that study, so it seemed to me a natural follow-on,\" she said.\"You die, your brain is no good to you. Can medical research use it? Well then yes, by all means take it!\"She said it was easy to sign up, but stressed the importance of telling your family of your intentions so they know what to do after your death.\"I had told my husband and I emailed my two daughters and said this is something I really want to do. Apart from one daughter saying, \\\'Bloody hell mum that is some kind of email to open when I am having my lunch!\\\' they were absolutely fine about it.\"And the researchers that use these samples every day are in no doubt of the debt they owe to donors.

This month, at the Farnborough International Airshow, we did our first We\\\'re very lucky to have the support of the new British cargo airline, CargoLogicAir, and their brand new 747-8F.  This is the biggest 747 ever, and can carry an amazing 138 tonnes of cargo in a loading bay 60m long (think the length of a tennis court, then double it, then add another 12 metres. It\\\'s huge).  As discussed in We will be surface-shipping about 15 container loads (around 100 tonnes) in advance, while we start to do our \"slow speed\" (200+ mph) UK runway testing at Newquay Aerohub.  Then we will fly the car, its road trailer, and the rest of the support equipment out to South Africa.  That\\\'s 100 tonnes to move 9,000km by air, so that we can crack on with getting the car up to around 800mph (and a new CargoLogicAir\\\'s 747 freighter is just what we need to make all of this happen.  Having tried it at Farnborough, the good news is that Bloodhound SSC fits nicely!  Now that we have sponsorship secured and a target date for record runs of next October, the engineering plan is starting to show the detail that will get us to South Africa.  The first order of business is for us to split the \"dry build\" car down to its component sub-assemblies.  Every part will then be assessed for any remaining work (including final machining, painting, etc.), before being put into our stores at the Bloodhound Technical Centre down in Bristol.  The dry build process is very useful for checking that everything fits together as planned (it\\\'s amazing how things never quite look the same when they jump off the screen and become a solid part).  It also allows us to check the things that are almost impossible to measure on a computer screen, like the space available to fit, service and (if necessary) replace a component.  For example, the car\\\'s jet fuel tank fits well, but we can\\\'t remove the access hatch on top once it\\\'s installed.  Inside the carbon fibre tank there is a flexible fuel bladder and, if this starts to leak for any reason, it will be a nightmare to fix.  It\\\'s an easy job to modify the tank lid now, so that\\\'s what we\\\'ll do, just in case we need to access the bladder out on the desert.  When everything is off the car, finished and painted, we\\\'ll start the reassembly process, getting the car ready to run for the first time.  If you want to see this process in action then join our As well as the strip down of all the existing components, we still have a few bits left to manufacture.  Major items are the big (and highly stressed) composite components, including the airbrakes and winglets.  As these are safety-critical items, they will be given plenty of attention to make sure we get them right.  The airbrake function sounds fairly obvious - put a couple of large flat plates out into the airflow to slow the car down.  They just need to be enormously strong to cope with five tonnes of aerodynamic load.  To make sure we can control the airflow, including the turbulence at supersonic speeds, the airbrakes are a fairly complicated shape, with a slightly curved surface and lots of holes to manage the frequency of the supersonic \"buffet\", or turbulent flow, behind them.  If you want to see how they are intended to work, have a look at our simple The winglets also sound like simple devices to make, with a fairly flat shape and straight edges.  However, if we need to trim out any residual aerodynamic loads, they may have to take several tonnes of force at some point.  Add a big safety margin and these carbon-fibre \"mini-wings\" need to be immensely strong.  Now add to the complexity by building in some surface pressure tappings (sensors), so that we can measure the air pressure distribution over the winglets.  This is a very good way to measure precisely where the shockwaves are forming, and moving, as we go supersonic.  A shockwave is literally a \"shock\" change in the air pressure (it\\\'s this sudden change in pressure that your ear detects as a loud bang - the so-called \"sonic boom\"), so the pressure changes on each winglet show us where the shockwaves are sitting.  We\\\'re not quite done with the winglet design yet, though.  There are a number of areas where We are going to \"A big part of sharing our Engineering Adventure with a global audience will involve video, including live streaming every time we run.  This means cameras, and lots of them.  Bloodhound SSC will be carrying 12 different on-board video cameras, including cameras on the tips of the winglets.  This is where the \"Adventure\" adds to the engineering task, as the cameras have to be built into the winglet structure.  With all these cameras on board, we aim to make BLOODHOUND SSC the world\\\'s fastest ever outside broadcast studio.  We\\\'ve already tested the desert comms system (which made for an A South African company called Poynting has made us some very special aerials to broadcast the signal.  These will be mounted on either side of the fin, broadcasting the video and data sideways to the 70m-tall Bloodhound mast that MTN has installed at Klipkolk, some 14km away.  The aerodynamic fairings for these aerials will need to be \"transparent\" to the high-frequency transmission signal, so they are made from a quartz fibre composite.  Although not as strong as carbon fibre, for instance, the quartz fibre will allow the video and data signals to pass through it.  The leading edge of the \"strake\" (the bit at the front of the fin, where it joins on to the top of the car) will also need to be transparent to radio, as this is where the car\\\'s VHF radio aerial will sit.  Another major work package for next year\\\'s runs is the testing and installation of the car\\\'s rocket system.  With the 12 miles available on Hakskeen Pan, the EJ200 jet engine will get us up to around 700mph before we need to slow down again, so getting to supersonic (760+ mph) speeds next year will require a bit more thrust.  To keep it simple for our first year of testing, we\\\'ll be using a \"monopropellant\" rocket system.  This is essentially leaving the hybrid fuel grain (i.e. the rocket fuel) out of the motor, and just using the energy contained in our high test peroxide (HTP) oxidiser.  HTP is amazing stuff, used mostly for the chemical industry, as it is a very powerful oxidiser.  Chemically, it\\\'s a water molecule (H2O) with an extra oxygen atom stuck on to make H2O2.  Forcing the HTP through a catalyst (we\\\'re using 80 layers of silver oxide mesh) will break down the bonds to release some (very hot) oxygen and lots of H2O (in the form of steam - it comes out at about 600C).  The hybrid rocket then uses this super-heated oxygen to burn the synthetic rubber fuel, generating the thrust needed for Bloodhound to reach 1,000mph.  Even without the fuel grain fitted, the HTP alone will generate nearly 50% of the thrust, which should be more than enough to get us supersonic. We\\\'re aiming for around 800mph next year.  Of course, it\\\'s not quite as simple as just leaving the fuel grain out.  Next year\\\'s \"mono\" rocket will need specialist parts, and lots of testing, to make sure that it works as advertised.  After all, this really is rocket science.  That is something the thousand of students who took part in the Bloodhound Model Rocket Car Competition will understand. Over 5,000 teams took part and our congratulations go to the Littlehampton Academy team, who clinched the national title with an impressive 48.4mph from their car \"Slim Jim\" (even the name sounds aerodynamic).  If you want to take part in the 2016/2017 competition, then you\\\'ve got until October to Each team will get a free rocket car kit, and the excitement of doing their own science experiment, complete with electronic data recording, powered by a solid rocket.

They\'re wrong - those cups aren\'t recyclable.','Every day hundreds of thousands of Britons put their coffee cup into a recycling bin. They\\\'re wrong - those cups aren\\\'t recyclable, and the UK throws away 2.5bn of them a year. It must stop, writes Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.One chilly morning last March - exactly the sort of morning when a warming cafe latte could seem appealing - I took to the streets of London in a double-decker bus adorned with 10,000 empty takeaway coffee cups. It might have looked like a piece of dodgy conceptual art, but it was actually designed to illustrate the vast volume of takeout cups we throw away daily in the UK. My bus didn\\\'t represent all of them, though - 10,000 is the number of cups the UK gets through in just two minutes.The British - like the Americans and Italians - are a nation of caffeine addicts. Walk down any busy street and you\\\'ll see people clutching coffee-filled cardboard vessels. That adds up to a huge number of used cups - more than seven million a day, or 2.5 billion a year. The sorry truth is, next to none of them are recycled - and the even sorrier fact is that no-one\\\'s taking responsibility for that, least of all the big coffee retailers who have created this takeout trash mountain.During my War on Waste battle, I\\\'ve looked at all kinds of issues related to food waste, such as the heinous \"cosmetic standards\" applied to supermarket fruit and veg that lead to mountains of perfectly good produce being dumped. The coffee cup crisis is somehow even more glaring - a wanton waste going on right under our noses. Most consumers wrongly assume that paper cups are a \"green\" choice. It\\\'s an assumption coffee companies are happy not to challenge. They know differently, but they\\\'re keeping that to themselves. They\\\'re not going to tell conscientious consumers that putting a used coffee cup in a recycling bin is pointless. But it is. The takeout cups that are the stock-in-trade of High Street coffee giants such as Starbucks, Caffe Nero and Costa are currently almost impossible to recycle. To make these cups waterproof, the card is fused with polyethylene, a material that cannot be separated out again in a standard recycling mill. What\\\'s more, the cups are not even made from recycled material in the first place - the way they are designed means one thin seam of card inside the cup comes into contact with the hot drink, so they have to be made from virgin paper pulp. And of course, they have very brief lives - just the time it takes to down a macchiato. The millions of coffee cups we use every day are, in effect, virgin materials with a single use, thrown almost immediately into the bin - a horrendous waste, with a hefty carbon footprint. These poly-lined cups are, technically, capable of being recycled - a fact that enables coffee companies to describe them as \"recyclable\". However, the reality is this is only possible in a highly specialised recycling facility - of which there are only two in the UK. One of these sites has never actually dealt with a single paper cup - the other has processed a very tiny number. In every meaningful sense, conventional paper coffee cups are not recyclable in Britain.There is nothing, of course, on the average takeout cup to let you know this. Some cups even sport the little Mobius-loop symbol - the three arrows in a triangle - which communicates a pleasant whiff of eco-friendliness to the hard-pushed coffee consumer. But this symbol is not necessarily an indication that the object can be easily recycled.If you go to the websites of the big coffee brands, you\\\'d be forgiven for thinking they\\\'ve got sustainability completely covered. But their claims are about as substantial as the froth on a poorly made cappuccino. \"Watching 20 tonnes of freshly dug parsnips consigned to the rubbish heap in a Norfolk farmyard - purely because they didn\\\'t look pretty enough - is still one of the most shocking things I\\\'ve ever seen,\" wrote Hugh Fearnley-Whittingstall.On the Costa website, for example, under the misleading headline \"great taste without the waste\", the company has the sheer brass neck to describe its cups as \"eco-friendly\" - perhaps the least accurate use of the term I\\\'ve ever heard. By way of justification, Costa explains that the card for its cups comes from sustainable wood pulp, before claiming that said cups \"are recyclable in a number of locations across the UK\". The number of locations, as I\\\'ve said, is two - max. And Costa sends less than 1% of its cups for this treatment.Starbucks, meanwhile, is uselessly vague. \"We\\\'re working on a solution to the challenges of paper cup waste,\" it says, before adding reassuringly that \"paper cups make up a small proportion of the waste produced in our stores\". That\\\'s a statement that means little without hard figures - though it does suggest they are being ridiculously wasteful in other ways too.These are just a couple of the companies keeping the UK awash with discarded coffee cups - there are, of course, many more. All of them are silently passing the responsibility for recycling cups on to their customers without fessing up to the fact that it is an all but impossible task.  What\\\'s the alternative to eco-unfriendly cups? Reusable ones are an option and Starbucks does offer customers a small incentive to choose these. But that incentive should be substantially increased and adopted by all the major coffee chains - reusable cups are not currently making any kind of dent in the problem.A change in coffee cup design is the second obvious answer. And the frustrating fact is that a recyclable paper coffee cup already exists. I visited inventor Martin Myerscough who demonstrated his version of the takeout cup which can be made from recycled paper and recycled after use in standard paper recycling facilities. Starbucks have announced that they are interested in testing out these new cups - but why aren\\\'t other coffee retailers snapping at his heels for the blueprint? When I challenged some of these retailers on camera, they earnestly expressed their commitment to \"look into\" the cup waste problem. That\\\'s not the same as doing something about it. If we\\\'re to see genuine progress, not just kneejerk PR responses, these companies need to feel the heat from the only people who can actually hurt them - that\\\'s you, the coffee-drinking public. Consumer pressure can make change happen very quickly. Following my War on Waste programmes last year, more than 300,000 people signed a letter to the UK\\\'s big retailers demanding they do something to reduce the waste they generate. Since then, many supermarkets have begun stocking more of the \"imperfect\" vegetables they had previously rejected, and increasing the amount of surplus stock they donate to charities, rather than to landfill. These are small steps, but encouraging and certainly cast-iron proof that the voices of customers ring in retailers\\\' ears. If enough people make a noise, these companies will have no choice but to step up and start dealing with their woeful waste issue.The German city of Hamburg has banned coffee pods from state-run buildings as part of an environmental drive to reduce waste.

Lord Erne said the two new boats were \"wonderful\". \"Growing up at Crom, living at Crom, we\\\'ve known nothing else but the Lough Erne cot,\" he said. \"My sisters got married from it, we took my late father over for his funeral in it in December, so it means a lot and it\\\'s lovely to see it being reinvented.\"Fred Ternan hopes to reintroduce cot racing on Lough Erne. \"With the two cots now that we have built we will be able to demonstrate cot rowing or pulling as it\\\'s known, how they can be brought in ashore and goods put on to them, how they can be used for racing, because the cots actually were raced and there were regular cot regattas for racing.\" On Saturday, Lough Erne Heritage will recreate what is known as the \"famous cot race\" that took place at Crom in 1856.The winners turned down the prize money on offer and instead asked Lord Erne to help arrange the return of their parish priest. Fr Clarke had fled to America after being told he was going to be arrested for officiating in a mixed marriage. Lord Erne was able to get the charges dropped and the priest came back to serve out his days in Newtownbutler. Now that their boat building project has been completed, Peter O\\\'Hanlon said the Cavan Town Men\\\'s Shed would have to come up with a new project. \"You spend all this time and put a huge amount of energy into actually building the boat and that\\\'s where the fun is and the craic is and the slagging and all the rest, and then you see the boat in the water and it\\\'s brilliant. \"But then it\\\'s finished, so where to next?\"When asked whether they would build another cot he laughs: \"Possibly, or maybe two!\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37132017','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-20 06:10:07',1),(164,'Economy Minister reverses green energy scheme decision','Economy Minister Simon Hamilton reverses a decision to withhold a report into fraud allegations in a lucrative green energy scheme.','The economy minister has reversed a decision to withhold a report into fraud allegations concerning a lucrative green energy scheme.In July the It also found it was open to abuse and had left taxpayers in Northern Ireland with a Simon Hamilton announced an audit of installations to check the fraud allegations.

Some people confide in friends or family, while others express their emotions through other means. Sixteen-year-old Odhran Bartley is dealing with his personal grief through music.Odhran was only seven years old when, in 2007, his dad unexpectedly died in his sleep at the age of 39. At the time Odhran says he wasn\\\'t ready to talk about his feelings. \"I had my mum to talk to, but I didn\\\'t really want to talk about it with anyone. I wanted to put it out there in music. I think emotion comes out best that way. \"I started rapping when I was nine, but only started writing my own material this year. \"It\\\'s a way to tell my stories and express my emotions.\"The first song Odhran wrote, called I can\\\'t forget you, was based on his dad\\\'s passing. \"It was emotional writing it. I was really sad at the time but I wanted to let people know what I had to say. \"Sometimes I feel sad when I perform it, but I think it\\\'s good that I do perform it as people who have gone through similar things can relate to it\". Odhran\\\'s mum, Anthea, says she had no idea that her son was such a talented musician. \"I really was surprised that he wrote about his dad\\\'s death because even though he had talked to me about his dad dying, he hadn\\\'t talked that much about it. \"When I heard the song, I could see that he was using it as a way to talk about his emotions and to keep him going\".

Campaigners want to stop traffic from passing under St Laurence\\\'s Gate, a Norman fortification.  The County Louth town at the mouth of the River Boyne is steeped in history.The 5,000-year-old Newgrange tomb is nearby, as is the Battle of the Boyne site.The town also hosts King William\\\'s mace. Oliver Cromwell laid siege to Drogheda and is reputed to have slaughtered many, but that is now disputed by some.The town was once a walled fortress and some of those fortifications remain, including St Laurence\\\'s Gate which was built in the 13th century. At the moment traffic can pass under the gate, but independent councillor Kevin Callan hopes that will soon change.\"When you look at the structure and its history, it was there to protect Drogheda from sea invasion,\" Mr Callan said.  \"It withstood Cromwell and many invasions and really and truly to have it damaged by a truck that could close it down after 800 years, it would be an absolute sin if we were to allow that to happen.\"Sin or not, a truck recently got stuck trying to pass through the arch of the stoned fortress known as a barbican.The image was published in several newspapers.St Laurence\\\'s Gate consists of two lofty circular towers joined together by a wall with strategically placed opening to allow the defenders to see out.Historian Audrey Smith is the secretary of the Close the Gate Campaign.\"Our idea is to protect the gate and all the medieval structures in Drogheda and make the gate the gateway to the north east and for Drogheda to be the jewel of that,\" she said. It\\\'s a laudable goal and one that seems to have the support of many townspeople.Hillary Kelly, who works in a local art gallery, said: \"From a practical point of view it\\\'s really dangerous for traffic.  And as a tourist attraction we can\\\'t really use it.  \"People can\\\'t get near it or up on it because it\\\'s dangerous.  We closed it to traffic at the beginning of May for a festival and for four hours people were able to get up on the monument and there are fantastic views of the sea and all around the countryside from it.  \"It got booked out in no time.  So, there is a market and for tourists to come and see it.\"Andrew Spearman, a photo-journalist, said: \"It should have been closed to traffic years ago.  It\\\'s a no-brainer.  If the will was there on the council, it would have been. But they\\\'ve been arguing for so long they\\\'ve forgotten what they\\\'re arguing about.\"   So, who, you might wonder is opposed to stopping traffic - estimated at more than 1,000 vehicles a day - from passing through the gate?\"Taxi drivers\" I was told, because they believe it would add to the already bad congestion.But, among them there was divided opinion and no one wanted to be interviewed on camera.If the campaigners get their way St Laurence\\\'s Gate might see the last vehicle pass under it later this year.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-36926027','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-16 00:30:46',1),(180,'Getting in touch','Send BBC News NI your comments, tell your own stories and share your pictures.','BBC News NI brings you news, analysis and debate from across Northern Ireland seven days a week on television, radio and online.Tell us what you think.

After a gritty performance at the 58kg women\\\'s wrestling category she won bronze, becoming the first Indian female wrestler and the fourth Indian woman to win an Olympic medal.\"I never thought I would become the first woman wrestler from India to bag an Olympic medal in wrestling,\" she told The Hindu newspaper. \"I hope the remaining wrestlers will also do well.\"She was born in India\\\'s Haryana state, where women were for some time not allowed to take part in wrestling events. The 23-year-old started training young, having gained support from her parents to pursue the sport.  Media reports say locals initially berated her parents, telling them that their daughter would become undesirable to potential suitors.  But she went on to earn a silver medal at the 2014 Glasgow Commonwealth Games and walked away with the bronze at the 2014 Incheon Asian Games. Thursday\\\'s bronze medal, was a \"result of 12 years of dedication\", she said. \"I never gave up to the end. In the last round, I had to give my maximum, I had the self belief,\" she said. Her father, Sukhvir Malik, told the BBC that \"Sakshi is now known to the entire country\". \"People have been celebrating outside our house since last night\", he said. He added that Sakshi was inspired by her grandfather, a wrestler, to start playing the sport.\"She trained extremely hard - day and night. She had promised me [she would] bring a medal and she has done that.\"She comes from the district of Rohtak, which gained notoriety in 2014, Women\\\'s wrestling really took off in India in the mid-1990s.

China\\\'s Tencent and Taiwan\\\'s Foxconn were the biggest investors in the latest cash injection. The tie-up with Tencent - the company behind China\\\'s messenger giant WeChat - is seen as key to expanding the range of services on Hike.Hike is a messenger app similar to many others, offering services such as messaging, voice calls and stickers. But the Indian app has won over many customers by including features catering to local demands such as higher privacy and the ability to send messages to be received as SMS texts. Given that many mobile phone users in India do not yet have data on their phones, the feature is a crucial advantage over competitors such as Whatsapp and Facebook Messenger. The link with China\\\'s Tencent as investor is expected to go beyond mere investment and involve  collaboration on technology and knowledge. Judging by the example that the Chinese giant set with WeChat in China, it is likely to set Hike on its way to become an all-in-one app. WeChat in China offers just about everything from messaging to calling, mobile games, food deliveries and online shopping. Hike already offers mobile games, news services, stickers and coupons.\"This shows you that messaging - even in India - can become a gateway to content services,\" Hike founder and chief executive Kavin Bharti Mittal told the BBC. \"So expect us to double down on that path.\"The company already has plans to integrate a payment platform into its services.  It is not Tencent\\\'s first foray into the Indian market. An attempt to launch their own WeChat app a few years ago was not very successful, despite significant marketing efforts. Hike was originally a joint project between Bharti and Softbank and has rapidly developed into a success story across India. The latest round of investments has added some $175m in funding with the majority coming from Tencent and Foxconn. The new money raised has lifted the company\\\'s value to what\\\'s referred to as \"unicorn\" status  - start-ups valued at more than $1bn. Existing investors in the app, including Softbank, Bharti Enterprise and Tiger Global, also contributed to the latest cash injection. Market leader Whatsapp says it has some 100 million active users in India.

Most people have come to watch the marquee race for the Nehru Trophy in the famed backwaters of the seaside town of Alappuzha (Allepy). But there are 50 more boats of various sizes and shapes, which are participating in different categories. One of those categories is for boats that used to be kitchens for the king of the region centuries ago. \"The snake boat race is an integral part of the culture of our community living in a place surrounded by water,\" says R Gopakumar, the captain of one of the boats competing for the Nehru Trophy, which is named after India\\\'s first prime minister Jawaharlal Nehru. The race represents the relationship between the community and the water. Interestingly, the relationship is best manifested in the spirit of competition. The thousands of small islands spread across the backwaters divide themselves into teams for the purpose of the race. They then build snake boats and rally behind their teams, almost always named after a village. Some boats are also named after saints and angels. The perceived harmony of the backwaters community seems to dissolve in the face of the fierce competition. \"We share our stories and our love with the other villages,\" says Antony Francis, a 40-year-old veteran of the snake boat race, who heads the Jawahar Boat Club. \"And we try to win the race.\" The snake boat race boasts of the biggest statistics for a game, but it takes only a little over four minutes for a boat to row to victory over a watery track of 1km (62miles). The oarsmen are put in high gear by the songs sung by the chanters and the beats of the drummers on board.The Nehru Trophy race is hosted by the port town of Alappuzha on the Arabian Sea, called the \"Venice of the East\" for its labyrinth of canals. \"The people of the backwaters celebrate the race as a festival of waters, coming together to support their teams by singing traditional boat songs,\" says R Girija, the top official of the region and the chairperson of the charitable society that manages the race. \"For the people of the backwaters, it is their own \\\'Olympics on water\\\'.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37081393','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-15 18:54:42',1),(192,'How Dipa Karmakar inspires a nation','Dipa Karmakar, India\'s first female Olympic gymnast, just missed bronze in the women\'s vaulting event, but managed to inspire fans across country.',' Dipa Karmakar, India\\\'s first female gymnast at the Olympics, may have just lost out on a medal but she won the hearts of a nation with her vaulting performance.She finished fourth in the women\\\'s vault gymnastics event on Sunday with a score of 15.966, just 0.15 points behind the bronze winner.

After four years, my target would be gold.\"Ms Karmakar was only one of two gymnasts to perform the Produnova vault, widely known as one of the most dangerous feats in gymnastics. It is often referred to as the \"vault of death\". The move consists of a front handspring off the vault, followed by two and a half somersaults. When asked if she would attempt the move, star US Olympian Simone Biles reportedly told The New Yorker, \"I\\\'m not trying to die\". Ms Karmakar completed the move and landed on her feet, but then reportedly sat down- causing her to lose points. However, she said that she was pleased with her result.\"This is my highest score in Produnova. I am very happy with my vault. I gave my whole effort to bring an Olympic medal for my countrymen. But it was tough luck.\"Ms Biles took the top prize in the vault, with Maria Paseka of Russia coming in second and Giulia Steingruber of Switzerland taking the bronze.Gymnastics does not receive much funding from the government of India, with Ms Karmakar earlier telling the BBC that she competed in her first gymnastics competition without shoes and in an ill-fitting costume.India won six medals in the 2012 Olympics, with four bronze and two silvers.

Moska Najib and Nazes Afroz captured the stories of this little-known community.In 1892,  India\\\'s first Nobel laureate, Rabindranath Tagore, wrote the iconic short story, Kabuliwala. It was the tale of a man from a distant land - Afghanistan - living in Kolkata, now the capital of West Bengal state. Over the past century, this interpretation has helped shape a romantic image of Afghans in Bengal and beyond.The men are typically thought to have distinctive features - piercing eyes and rugged faces. Dressed in their traditional attire, they seem at home in a city which is thousands of miles away from their own homeland. The name from Tagore\\\'s story is still in use and the Afghans of Kolkata are called Kabuliwalas, which means \"people of Kabul\". While the city has become their new abode, they carry with them their distinct tradition. Dadgul Khan has been living in central Kolkata for more than five decades with his Indian wife and family. Mr Khan was born in Afghanistan and moved to India with his father as a young man. His son by his Indian wife is a keen cricketer. Armed with spices, dry fruits and attar (perfumes) from their country, the first Kabuliwalas went from door-to-door selling their wares. Over the decades, they have moved to other businesses, including setting up tailoring shops in the city\\\'s Burrabazar area. The Kabuliwalas can often be found enjoying the local food in the city\\\'s restaurants. Some Kabuliwalas carry mementos passed on by earlier generations. Here, Sultan Khan shows off his mother\\\'s dress from nearly half a century ago. Age-old customs and traditions link the generations and have kept this little-known community going. Today, there are only 5,000 Kabuliwala families in Kolkata, a city of 16 million people. Many of the Kabuliwalas, though born in Kolkata, lead the life of \"stateless\" people without any citizenship documents. But regardless of their official status, the city offers them a final resting place in this graveyard.

It was a huge house, with beautiful gardens and 40 fruit trees,\" Mr Fernandes says. \"When it all came tumbling down, it compelled me to look at the changing city. And I started drawing places that I remembered fondly while I was growing up.\" The result is a collection of about 75 paintings and drawings - \"completely nostalgia driven\" - looking at the \"good old days\" in a happy, humorous way. Here, Mr Fernandes explains the stories behind some of his works.The Bangalore Club, one of the finest examples of British architecture in the city, is still looked after well. Established in 1868 by a group of British officers, the club boasted some exclusive members, including former British prime minister Winston Churchill \"It is still looked after very well and it still has very exclusive members,\" Mr Fernandes says.In the \"good old days\", people didn\\\'t have to go to barbers; they instead came to people\\\'s homes. \"He would ride in on a bicycle, carrying his tools in a cloth bag. A chair would be brought out and placed under a tree and the entire family - men, boys and girls - would queue up to get their hair cut.\"There was one disadvantage though, Mr Fernandes says. The barber knew only one style and he would cut everyone\\\'s hair in the same fashion.\"My sisters would show him fashionable hairstyles from international magazines and ask for a similar cut. They would, of course, never get one. \"And then in the 1970s, we all started to grow our hair, hippie-style,\" says Mr Fernandes. \"The barber didn\\\'t like it one bit, he said it was bad for business.\"The Coffee House on MG Road was \"the centre of our universe\", it was \"very popular\" and often frequented by journalists, Mr Fernandes says.The place did - and still does - great coffee, it served dosa and omelette and was always packed at meal times.\"Sometimes, we would have journalists sitting on the next table and they would chat about headlines and it would be in the next day\\\'s papers. It was so thrilling.\"Commercial Street was the centre of shopping in Bangalore - it\\\'s a place where one could buy anything, from clothes to jewellery to household stuff to footwear. It also had toyshops and many tailors.\"My mother would drive me and all my nine siblings there once a year at Christmas to buy us clothes,\" says Mr Fernandes. \"She would buy the same bale of cloth, take us to the tailor who would take our measurements, and all of us would get identical clothes.\"The Cubbon Park police station is a \"very beautiful\" building. It was an old British house that was converted into a police station in 1910 and it is still \"pretty much the same\".\"In the 60s and 70s, Bangalore was a very laid back place and there was no real crime, occasionally maybe a cycle would be stolen,\" Mr Fernandes says. \"I was in school then and my friends and I would cycle around the city and the policemen looked so silly in their flowerpot hats, so we would tap them and run away. But once I got caught and was detained in the room you see on top here. I was let out only after my mother came to the police station and apologised,\" he remembers.This house in this illustration is the cartoonist\\\'s ancestral home and the girl was one of his sisters.\"She was very pretty and young boys would come by to greet her. A protective uncle would be hovering nearby, scowling, with an airgun, trying to scare away the boys,\" Mr Fernandes says.Just below the British Council in Bangalore was the very popular Koshy\\\'s bar and restaurant. It is still hugely popular, so much so that even the state\\\'s chief ministers come here for a coffee or a drink. During a visit to the city in the 1980s, Britain\\\'s Prince Charles dropped by for a cup of coffee.\"This very picturesque railway line crossing is barely half a kilometre from my present home,\" Mr Fernandes says. In the 1960s and 70s, a daily train from Madras (now Chennai) to Bangalore used to pass through the area and the gates would shut for 10 minutes.\"Whenever we were at the gate, we would wave at the passengers, and they would wave back at us.\"The Brigade Road was Bangalore\\\'s \"most iconic hangout\" place in the 70s - all the city\\\'s fashionable people would go there in the evenings for fun.An Indian-American couple set up a restaurant there and introduced Bangaloreans to apple pie and waffles, there were a couple of pinball machines and musically-inclined people would hang out with their guitars; and there was a coffin-maker nearby.\"In those days, we used to say you come to Brigade Road for recreation, sustenance and death. Unfortunately, it\\\'s all gone now, replaced by a huge mall,\" says Mr Fernandes. The cartoonist\\\'s \"sprawling home ground\" was filled with trees, birds and dogs and this artwork shows a corner of that house.\"It was customary for gentlemen in the house to have a good lunch and a siesta in the gardens. It was a man\\\'s domain - by some unwritten rule a lady would never sit out there.

Even the police didn\\\'t take them seriously,\" says Mr Devineni.The comic reflects that harsh reality too - when Priya tells her parents about the rape, she\\\'s blamed for it and banished from home.Priya is representative of a generic Indian woman and her aspirations. \"She is like every boy or girl who wants to live his or her dreams. But those dreams are quashed after her rape,\" says Mr Devineni.In the book, with some help from Shiva and Parvati - Hinduism\\\'s most powerful divine couple - Priya manages to turn her tragedy into an opportunity. In the end, she rides back into the town on the back of a tiger and vanquishes her adversaries.Mr Devineni says he chose mythology to put his point across because Hinduism is India\\\'s majority religion - more than 80% of the country\\\'s 1.2 billion people are Hindus - and its myths and stories are woven into its cultural life.He convinced street artists and Bollywood poster painters to create murals in the Mumbai area of Dharavi, Asia\\\'s biggest slum. The paintings have \"augmented reality features\" which allow people to see special animation and movies pop out of the wall art when they scan it with their smart phones.People anywhere in the world can download a free digital copy of the comic and printed copies in Hindi and English will be available at the \"Our target audiences are children starting from 10-12 years to young adults. It\\\'s a very critical age in their lives and it\\\'s an attempt to start a conversation with them.\" In India, where one rape is reported every 16 minutes, the 2012 Delhi gang rape is seen as a game-changer - the brutality of the six men led to days of protests and forced the government to introduce tougher anti-rape laws, including the death penalty for particularly severe sex crimes.Commentators say tougher laws can only partly solve the problem. What is really needed is to create awareness and change social attitudes.Mr Devineni says that is what his project attempts to do. Urvashi Butalia, head of feminist publisher Zubaan Books, says its success or failure will depend \"a lot on the story\" and also \"on how many people it reaches\". She says anything that creates a conversation helps. \"Many of the changes in the world have come from ideas. And it\\\'s an interesting idea - you don\\\'t get too many female superheroes,\" she says.Jasmeen Patheja is the founder of Blank Noise Project which is running a campaign called \"I never asked for it\" - it meaning rape or sexual assault.The project creates public installations and an online gallery of garments survivors were wearing when they were sexually abused as part of a campaign on \"rejecting and arresting blame\".The biggest change, she says, will be \"when people understand that there is no excuse to justify sexual violence, the garments women wear, what time they go out or the place they go to\".\"Graphic novels, comics, story books, films - all have immense potential to help,\" she says.

Thirty years later, many still bear the scars - they include children with birth and congenital defects and others whose lives have been blighted by chronic illness.Nazes Afroz travels to Bhopal to meet children born to parents who were exposed to the gas on 3 December 1984 or who were born in the aftermath of the leak.Aseem Ansari, 15, was born with acute deformities of his facial bones and suffers from chronic weakness, fatigue and frequent nose bleeds. Mother Hanifa Bee has been taking him to hospitals and clinics ever since he was born. He has dropped out of school and works in a furniture factory to help his family financially. He knows little about the gas leak that affected his parents when they were in their youth. Swati Mishra, 17, was born with partial paralysis of the left side of her body. She suffers from acute weakness and has been visiting hospitals and doctors all her life. Her father was a young boy at the time of the leak but she knows little about the accident. Swati is studying computer administration at a local college and her aim is to find work either at a bank or the railways so she can support her father who has very little income. Twenty-one-year-old Sheraz Raeen, who was born with severe brain damage, needs constant care. He cannot speak or look after himself. His family sends him to a day-care centre set up by one of the local groups demanding rights for the gas victims. From the time of his birth, his family has been paying for his medical treatment at government hospitals as well as private clinics. Sheraz\\\'s full time carer, his mother Firoza Bee, asks: \"When will he be categorised as a victim of the gas leak and when will he be paid compensation and get proper medical care?\" Sheraz\\\'s younger sister, 17-year-old Gulnar Raeen, was born with a minor defect in her right leg. She also has chronic weakness and breathing difficulties. A school dropout, Gulnar has a vague knowledge of the disaster. She only knows that her parents were affected by a gas leak from the Union Carbide factory. Both of Faizan Shaikh\\\'s parents were affected by the gas leak and he was born with severe problems in his right eye and has been treated for it since his birth. Although the 15-year-old looks healthy, he gets out of breath easily and can\\\'t do much physical work. He has dropped out of school and now works as an assistant in a photography studio. Shaima Shaikh, 15, was born with a minor birth defect in one of her feet. She suffers from chronic fatigue and has frequent headaches and blackouts. Her mother has also suffered acutely from being exposed to the gas since a young age. Shaima has little information about the accident and whatever little she knows, she has heard it from her family. Asif Shaikh, 29, was born four months after the disaster. His mother, who lived in a slum just a stone\\\'s throw away from the factory, was in the final stages of pregnancy when the leak occurred. Mr Shaikh suffers from chronic weakness and has eye and breathing troubles. He can\\\'t do much physical labour and hence assists in the family-run flour mill. Chetna Koli, 21, has heard about the thousands killed and maimed in her slum from her parents who were also victims of the leak. She has also seen photos and films made about the accident. She has chronic eye irritation and suffers from breathlessness. Her 15-year-old brother was born with a tumour on his back and had to undergo surgery three days after birth. After school, she joined a course to be a lab technician and wants a job in a hospital or a clinic so that she can support her father, another gas victim who has a meagre income. Gas Mohammad was so named because he was born on the morning of 3 December 1984, just hours after the leak. An unusually quiet man, he doesn\\\'t communicate much and suffers from severe weakness and breathlessness. Due to poor health, he cannot do work involving manual labour. So, he does odd jobs when he finds them. His aunt, who lives with his family, gave birth to a child exactly a year after the accident but the baby died minutes after he was born. Gas Mian was also born just hours after the leak killed and maimed tens of thousands of people in his neighbourhood. \"Do I look like a 30-year-old man? I look much older. This accident blighted my life,\" he says when asked about the incident. His seven-year-old son Faran was born with a defective foot. The Mian family still carries the legacy of the accident that ruined the lives of thousands of poor slum dwellers like him.

Last Tuesday night, the situation came to a head when university vice-chancellor Abhijit Chakraborty called in police to quell a protest on the campus. Mr Chakraborty says he called in the police because he was under siege and had to be rescued. Dozens of students were injured and admitted to hospital. Supratik Sur Roy, a student of film studies, says it was \"completely unacceptable\" to send \"commandos and police to beat up students who were protesting peacefully\". Ms Chakraborty, an undergraduate student of English, says she was present on the night and that police came inside the campus and beat up the students. She has alleged that her boyfriend was severely beaten up and suffered multiple injuries. The students are now demanding that the vice-chancellor resign and Ms Chakraborty says she will not give up protesting until he quits. Mr Ghosh, an MPhil student of comparative literature, says: \"I am proud to be a part of this movement. I was not present on the night when police came, but I wish I was there with my friends who were beaten up.\" The poster behind him, with the war cry Halla bol (Raise your voice), aptly sums up the mood of the protesting students.\"We are not only fighting against the vice-chancellor, we are addressing other issues as well.

Even though he has set up the latest offset printing facility, he has kept his letterpress in business doing small jobs printing pamphlets, books, letterheads and menu cards.Mr Baag works out of a small space divided into two storeys - the lower floor houses the press while the loft is where he composes the written material.In letterpress printing, which has been around since the 15th Century, letters are manually set into a tray, doused with ink and stamped against paper. Over the years, Mr Baag has composed material in Bengali and English. Here, he is seen working on a menu card for a caterer. At his press, it\\\'s a one-man show where he is the compositor as well as the pressman. Mr Baag has at least 400kg of Hindi, Bengali and English typefaces in his press and he has to remember which bit is kept in which box. Once Mr Baag has prepared the written material, he goes down from the loft to the press area with the tray.As printing starts, he feeds paper into the machine.Even though the treadle machine runs on electricity, it can also be operated by manual pedalling in case of a power outage.

The opportunity was so important for me,\" she says. Instead, she concentrated on following the crew\\\'s instructions to the letter.She leapt off the building - and to everyone\\\'s delight, and Tandon\\\'s relief, she pulled it off perfectly.It was actually the first thing that had gone right for Tandon for many years.Her mother had died when she was nine, and her father was left raising four daughters alone in a poor area of the city. They often went hungry.There was no money to pay for schooling, so Tandon would sneak out of the house to play cricket and other games with the boys in the neighbourhood.She really was a tomboy, she says, and a better cricketer than boys a year or two older than her.\"My sister used to get upset and say, \\\'Be like a girl, stop wearing boys clothes - dress like a woman!\\\' But I never used to listen to her.\"But it was her father who was most deeply troubled by her adventurous spirit.\"He could see I was very different,\" she says. He was also worried that a boy would take advantage of her, so when she was 15 he arranged a match with a man from a wealthier family. Within two days she was married.Initially, she was thrilled, welcoming the prospect of a better life and the promise of a stable family unit - but she hadn\\\'t counted on having to consummate the marriage immediately.\"I was young, I wasn\\\'t ready for him to touch me,\" she says.But he went ahead anyway, marking the beginning of a long period of hideous abuse.\"He beat me every day,\" she says. \"He beat me so hard I suffered from vertigo.\"She attempted suicide twice by drinking poison, but failed. She hoped that bearing children would give her respite from the abuse, but it was unrelenting. \"Every day of my marriage was a punishment,\" she says.When she went to the police, they turned her away.When she went to stay with her sister, her husband followed her and burned her brother-in-law\\\'s rickshaw. The guilt of bringing trouble to their door drove her to return to her husband\\\'s family.Finally one day she decided that if she wanted to live, she had to escape, and fled with her children to a temple, but she knew it could only be a temporary solution. \"I didn\\\'t want to be a beggar,\" she says. \"I knew I had to find work elsewhere, so I left.\"It\\\'s tough being a single parent in Mumbai, Tandon says. \"People in my culture are very suspicious of single women. If you tell them you are unmarried, nobody will give you a room.\"She moved from district to district desperately chasing scraps of work. One week she\\\'d be making 250 One day she met a finely dressed group of women who seemed to have plenty of work. \"I asked them if they could help find me a job. They told me they worked in a massage parlour.\"Confident in her massaging abilities, Tandon naively turned up for work as a masseuse. \"I didn\\\'t know much about the world then, I had no idea what a massage parlour was, or that the women there were sex workers,\" she says.As soon as she found out she was horrified. \"The women laughed at me. They said: \\\'You have two children to feed and you\\\'re not educated, what other work will you be able to do?\\\'\"Their words echoed her husband\\\'s vicious verbal abuse.\"I wanted to do something with integrity. I wanted to be able to look in the mirror and not feel guilty about anything I did.\"Eventually, Tandon\\\'s uncle put her touch with a group of Bhangra dancers.What she lacked in natural skill for the art, she made up for in gumption. Dancing her way on to Bollywood film sets with gusto, she says, \"I was a bad dancer, but the others in the group were very kind and they covered for me all the time.\"It was there that she got her big break as a stuntwoman, but although her reputation soon spread throughout Bollywood, it was not plain sailing.\"On my second shoot I was on set performing a stunt with fire and the wind blew the flames in my face. I had severe burns all over my lips, face and eyebrows and I was on medication for two months,\" she says.On another occasion she fell from a building and fractured her spine.\"I was rushed to hospital in and bedridden for two months.\" In those days, with bills to pay, Tandon really couldn\\\'t afford to be injured. \"The doctor told me to rest, but I had to go back to work because I needed money for the rent and my children\\\'s education,\" she says.Six years, and hundreds of highly technical stunts later, Tandon now has more than enough work to get by.  She\\\'s one of Bollywood\\\'s most skilled and daring stunt performers and one of the very few action women willing to take part in a high-speed car chase. It\\\'s precisely her ability to play as hard and fast as the boys that makes her so great at her job.She doesn\\\'t mind that some people don\\\'t regard it as a suitable job for a woman. \"When I was married at 15, then society didn\\\'t help or support me,\" she says, \"so why should I care what society thinks of me?Attitudes to women in India are still in dire need of change, she says.

Her seven-year-old daughter Nargis sits beside her, leafing through her textbooks. A table fan blows directly onto them, a fervent but ineffective warrior in the heat. On the wall behind the bed is a cabinet filled with toys for Nargis. Nurjahan, almost 29, is now in her last month of treatment for multi-drug resistant tuberculosis (MDR-TB) - a type of  tuberculosis which is unresponsive or resistant to at least two of the first line of anti-TB drugs. MDR-TB often develops due to mismanagement of treatment, misuse of anti-TB drugs, use of poor quality medicine or when a patient doesn\\\'t complete the TB regimen. Drug-resistant TB is harder and more expensive to diagnose and treat, often pushing families into poverty. India is estimated to have close to 100,000 cases of MDR-TB.In 2008, Nurjahan was taking care of her elder sister, who was an MDR-TB patient being treated in Delhi. Her sister did not survive, as her diagnosis had been delayed and she didn\\\'t  get appropriate treatment. Soon after, Nurjahan started coughing and was diagnosed with drug sensitive TB. She was put on the government\\\'s free treatment and pronounced cured after six months. In 2009, she married her sister\\\'s husband, who is also her cousin.It\\\'s unclear why her TB returned, but in 2010 Nurjahan was coughing again. This time she went to a local doctor in Katwa in Burdwan district. He also diagnosed her with drug sensitive TB. Nurjahan was not convinced and went to the Katwa government hospital and got herself tested to confirm his diagnosis. The results left her devastated.  \"I thought six months of treatment was the end of TB. Nobody tells you it can happen again and again,\" she says bitterly.  Unfortunately, neither doctor tested her for drug-resistance - a practice that is widespread in India even today.Nurjahan has now been on treatment for almost four years for a disease that is usually cured within six-24 months. She frequently looks out of the window by which she sits - sometimes all day - trying hard to recollect dates, but often mixing them up. \"Nurjahan was given category one drugs [used for the treatment of new patients] once but given category two drugs twice despite failure the first time.  Weren\\\'t you?\" Rano, her counsellor, a relatively young but persuasive woman reminds her. Nurjahan nods vigorously.Recognising that category one had failed, in 2010 Nurjahan was started on category two, a more intensive set of drugs, with more virulent side-effects. With no improvement in test results, she was given category two drugs again in 2011, instead of being tested for drug resistance. \"What could we do? There was no treatment for drug resistant TB available then,\" says Rano helplessly.  The government program for the treatment of MDR-TB was yet to begin. This repeated use of ineffective treatment possibly exacerbated her resistance.She was still on category two drugs when a national laboratory was established in Kolkata. Her sputum sample was sent there for a drug sensitivity test and came back positive, confirming MDR TB.  The government treatment program for MDR-TB had also begun, and she was finally put on the correct treatment.Despite the misdiagnosis and four years of treatment, Nurjahan refused to give up. She was determined to get well and be a good mother. Her biggest fear was infecting Nargis. So for several months in her first year of treatment, Nargis stayed away from her and was looked after by her mother-in-law. Throughout her illness, Nurjahan\\\'s mother took care of her. She moved into the house intermittently, often for months, to take care of her and Nargis. \"I would not have survived without her or my husband\\\'s support,\" says Nurjahan.The treatment for MDR-TB was hard to tolerate. Nurjahan winces as she recalls that time. \"Sometimes, my whole body would break into small rashes and my stomach would burn for months.\" There are still rashes over small areas on her face and body. Not surprisingly, Nurjahan often contemplated giving up, but the constant presence of Nargis stopped her. Initially, Nur\\\'s husband panicked with her diagnosis. However, the doctors\\\' counselling helped and he understood that MDR-TB was treatable. The doctor advised him to improve her nutrition but money was limited. As a result, her husband, who is a tailor, moved to Bangalore to make more money. \"We couldn\\\'t afford my food and her education with work here,\" Nur says, gesturing gently towards Nargis.Despite living in the same house, few in her husband\\\'s family helped her during her illness. Yet, they surround her as she recounts her story. Her father-in-law interrupts her constantly, assuring us that they are all concerned about her.  Nurjahan falls silent.Nurjahan is excited about her last month of treatment. She asks her counsellor softly if she can become a mother post treatment. She wants to send Nargis to a better school and bring her husband back home. \"I want to make my family whole again,\" she says smiling looking out of the window at a glorious orange evening sky.

I earn 6,000 rupees ($90; \\xc2\\xa369).Seven years ago, my family was struggling, we had borrowed 100,000 rupees from people, mostly to pay the fee of our school-going children, and the debts had to be repaid. One day, I met a man who worked as an agent for a surrogacy clinic. He told me that I could earn 200,000 rupees being a surrogate mother.I knew two other women in my neighbourhood who had been surrogate mothers so I agreed.I thought, I have four children, and now I can help someone who cannot have any. I was thinking how horrible it would be if my daughter couldn\\\'t bear children. I believe everyone should have children and I wanted to help.I never met the real parents and have no idea who they are. I was still under sedation when they removed the baby. I never set eyes on it. I have no idea whether it\\\'s white or black, whether it\\\'s Indian or foreigner, I don\\\'t even know whether it\\\'s a boy or a girl!When I gained consciousness, my first words to my husband were, \\\'Did you see the baby? Is it a boy or a girl?\\\' He said he hadn\\\'t seen it. I asked my doctor, but she didn\\\'t answer my question.\\\'You are a surrogate mother, you shouldn\\\'t ask these questions,\\\' she said.But I want to know about the baby. I want to know where he or she is and what it is studying.For three months after giving birth, I spent sleepless nights, I would get headaches thinking about the baby and I had to take medicines to calm down.Every year, on 4 November, the day the baby was born, our family celebrates its birthday. I do all the rituals that I do for my other children.I fast in the morning, I cook payasam [rice pudding] and share it with my family and neighbours, and I visit the temple to pray for the baby\\\'s well-being and long life. I\\\'ve always wondered if the baby is like any of my other children. I really do miss the baby and would give anything to see it once.I know it\\\'s not my baby after all, but I know that if I\\\'d seen the baby, I wouldn\\\'t have given it away.I hope the baby is happy and fine wherever it is.We talk a lot about it, we call it Paapa or Kuzanthai (Tamil words for baby or child) and at times, my family thinks maybe it would have been happier with us.But then, we are a poor family and in difficult times, we think that perhaps the baby\\\'s better off in a wealthier family.I work in a shop where I earn 150 rupees a day. My husband works as a painter, doing paint jobs on people\\\'s homes at the daily rate of 500 rupees. I have two children - a boy, 11, and a girl, 10.Seven years ago we were faced with financial ruin. My husband was unwell for a while and we had borrowed 150,000 from friends, relatives and neighbours, mostly to pay our rent.When I proposed to my husband that I could make 200,000 rupees for surrogacy, he was upset, he thought I was going to do something immoral. But then when the procedure was explained to him, he understood it and agreed.While I was in the hostel, my family was allowed to visit only once a month and that was very hard for me.I was warned that whatever happened, I couldn\\\'t go home, but then thankfully nothing untoward happened which required me to visit them.My son was only four at the time and he asked me if I was going to have a baby. I told him that I was ill and that\\\'s why my stomach was swollen and I had to be admitted to hospital for treatment. My son bought my story, but if it was my daughter she would have asked me lots of questions. She is very inquisitive, but thank god, she was only three then and too young to understand. I never saw the baby after it was born. I told the doctor that I would like to see it, at least once. But she said, \\\'No, it will make you feel guilty.\\\' For the first month, I cried a lot but my husband kept reminding me that \\\'it\\\'s not our baby, it belongs to others, we did this for money\\\'. I understand the child belongs to its parents and I was only renting out my womb, but since I carried it for nine months, it would be nice to get to know the parents. I don\\\'t want to interact with the baby, but I just want to see it from a distance. But we no longer speak about the baby at home.With the money I earned, we managed to pay off all our debts and rented a home on a long-term lease, but the lease runs out next year and I\\\'m thinking about being a surrogate mother for the second time.Of course, my children are older now and I can\\\'t fool them any more. So I\\\'ll tell them it\\\'s our child. What will happen when the baby is born and taken away? I will cross that bridge when I come to it.I work in a factory and earn 3,500 rupees a month. My husband is a rickshaw driver and he makes 5,000 rupees a month. In 2008, my husband had left home after a fight and it became impossible for me to even feed my children. In the past, I had donated an egg at a fertility clinic so I decided to do it again to make some money, but the doctor there asked me to be a surrogate.My mother and mother-in-law were unconvinced, they didn\\\'t speak to me during my pregnancy.I never laid eyes on the baby and I think maybe it was for the best because if I had seen it, I would have felt very guilty giving it up.But it was hard, I had felt the baby move in my belly, I had become attached to it, and I couldn\\\'t see it. It just disappeared. For about two-three years, I felt very bad and I lost a lot of weight.But now I don\\\'t want to see it. At home, we don\\\'t talk about it. I even discourage my husband from talking about it because I know it belongs to someone else.I have made peace with myself.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37050249','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-15 07:08:27',1),(215,'Girl power','India launches a social media campaign to celebrate daughters, daughters-in-law and granddaughters - asking people to celebrate the young women and girls in their lives.','India has launched a campaign on social media to celebrate daughters, daughters-in-law and granddaughters this week and is observing a Daughter\\\'s Day on Thursday.Women and Child Development Minister Maneka Gandhi told the BBC that the Daughters\\\' Day and the Daughters\\\' Week were aimed at reducing female foeticide, improving India\\\'s skewed sex ratio and educating girls. \"We are asking people to celebrate the young women and girls in their lives,\" Mrs Gandhi said. \"The time has come to celebrate women. Women are doing much better now, there\\\'s more confidence in them. We want to spread the message that the girl child should be valued,\" she added.To kick-off the campaign to mark Daughters\\\' Day on Thursday, she tweeted a photograph with her daughter-in-law and granddaughter.The campaign asks people to post photographs with their daughters, daughters-in-law and granddaughters on Facebook, Twitter and other social media platforms using the hashtag #BBBPDaughtersWeek.And in the first few days of the launch of the campaign, Mrs Gandhi has re-tweeted dozens of photos sent by people to her.On the face of it, it seems to be a fun campaign, but dig a little deeper and what is at stake is much more serious.India, and Indians, are often accused of patriarchy. And a look at the government data confirms that India is often very unkind to those of the female gender.A preference for sons has led to For decades, the authorities and campaigners have struggled to deal with these challenges.Over the years, India has brought in tougher laws banning sex selective abortions, dowry has long been outlawed, there are civil remedies available to women trapped in abusive marriages and rape laws have been rewritten to include the death penalty.Of course, there are more positive stories about Indian women - today there are many powerful women politicians, scientists, in leading banks - both private and government, and in the corporate sector. But patriarchal attitudes are deeply entrenched in Indian society continue.Mrs Gandhi explains why her campaign singles out daughters, daughters-in-law and granddaughters:The government, she says, is working hard to better the lot of the women and the girl child.In January last year, Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched In his monthly radio address last year, Mr Modi asked fathers across the country to click selfies with their daughters and send them to him, Mrs Gandhi\\\'s Daughters\\\' Day campaign is another attempt to chip away at the patriarchy and to cajole more people to begin valuing their daughters.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37034444','2016-08-20 12:25:06','2016-08-11 07:12:54',1),(216,'Steamy wicket','Former Australian fast bowler Brett Lee faces his latest test - a cross-cultural romantic comedy that has come under scrutiny from Indian censors.','One of the fastest bowlers in cricket history has made an unlikely career move - starring in a romantic comedy.The film UnIndian was shot in Sydney and will open across 300 screens on the cricket-mad sub-continent after a red-carpet premiere on 19 August.Australian cricket legend Brett Lee plays an English teacher who falls in love with a single mother played by Bollywood star Tanishtha Chatterjee.Lee - who is hugely popular in India - told the BBC that he has always seen himself as something of an actor.\"On the cricket field I\\\'m totally different on the field to what I am off the field,\" Lee said.\"It came naturally to be in front of the camera.\"Since his playing days, Lee has built a presence in India - appearing in a string of TV commercials and even releasing a music single.He also established some Bollywood connections playing in the Indian Premier League - playing under Shah Rukh Khan for the Kolkata Knight Riders and Preity Zinta for the Kings XI Punjabs.The cricket star was offered the leading role in the \\xc2\\xa32.6 million (US$3.4m) film after meeting with the director over a cup of coffee.\"He showed me the script, which I loved - an Australian film with a bit of Bollywood flavour, a bit of Bollywood culture and beautiful message through the film - that love has no boundaries.\"In the film, Chatterjee plays a divorced single mother with a career whose family want her to find \"a nice Indian man\".Instead she meets Lee\\\'s character, who may be nice but is definitely not Indian.\"She\\\'s an absolute sweetheart to work with, a consummate professional,\" Lee said.\"Very, very funny when the camera\\\'s not rolling.

The sentiment was formalised when a However, Rio 2016 saw a whole new side to the nation\\\'s Olympians, as athletes revealed their personalities on social media.The swimmer Fu Yuanhui delighted fans with her unscripted interviews, and garnered international praise from columnists and social media enthusiasts when she broke a sporting taboo For her part, Fu said social media fame was not her goal.She wrote on her Weibo page: \"I wish all hard-working people will have their dreams come true. I\\\'m not an internet star, nor an \\\'emoji queen\\\', I\\\'m a professional athlete.\"Then videos of her teammate, the higher jumper Zhang Guowei, went viral when he demonstrated some lively dance moves.As he stretched his arms wide while standing on one foot, the unique gesture was dubbed \"white crane spreads its wings\". One internet user on Weibo said, \"Finally, people start to notice Zhang Guowei. He is so cute! I love his dance.\" Another user joked that \"Zhang Guowei could be a perfect boyfriend for swimmer Fu Yuanhui on the Chinese Valentine\\\'s day.\" However some social media users dubbed it \"arrogant\".Zhang Guowei also used social media to apologise when he failed to win any medals.He wrote on his Sina Weibo account: \"Don\\\'t find excuses for me. As a professional jumper, I failed. The moment when I landed on the mat, I shivered with fear and guilt. I\\\'m very sorry that I let you down.\"Then there\\\'s the story of 100m freestyle swimmer Ning Zetao.His Ning was featured on the August 2016 cover of Elle Men China. The country was so taken with his looks that he earned the nickname \"Baozi\" which means \"steamed bun\". He\\\'s even used the term himself.Ahead of the games, there were reports that he would be cut from the team because he had been involved in too many commercial endorsements.But he took to social media to reassure his fans.\"There has suddenly been news recently about the Steamed Bun that has caused concern among many leaders, media, friends, family and Bun fans who have come one after another to show concern and seek proof,\" Ning said in a \"Striving for glory for the nation at the Olympics is without a doubt the biggest dream of a lifetime for all athletes and is my greatest motivation in training hard and swimming forward each day.\"And then there\\\'s diver Qin Kai, who revealed a lot about his personality when he asked a very personal question to fellow diver He Zi in front of millions of viewers.He, of course, Speaking after the proposal, he said the move was \"just in my character really, I often do surprising or dramatic things\".In Rio, it seems, a new generation of Chinese Olympians have become the country\\\'s social media stars.

Although the market is not quite as smooth and borderless for financial services as it is for, say, manufacturing, the City has been pretty happy with that deal. Not least because an awful lot of international banks and other businesses have set up their European headquarters in London to take advantage of \"passporting\". That means that if a company is regulated in one EU country, it can do business in any other given it has a passport to do business anywhere in the EU. The financial services industry therefore came out strongly - though not unanimously - in favour of Remain. There are, of course, plenty of business leaders in financial services who think the UK can now prosper even better outside the EU. But as an industry, the City lost the argument at the ballot box and it is now debating what deal the UK government can negotiate to ensure its future. The options come down to something the well-dressed City slicker knows all about. Does it go for an off-the-peg arrangement, or have something made bespoke?Off-the-peg would be best for many in financial services: they would prefer that if the UK is to leave the EU, it should at least stay in the single market, which would include that all-important passporting. However, it is looking increasingly likely that the off-the-peg solution is just not an option. That is because membership of the single market has always come at a high price, allowing the free movement of people from across the EU and paying money into the coffers of the EU. The City, which has been testing the waters, seems to have decided that is just not going to happen. As prime minister Theresa May said, \"Brexit means Brexit\". And with many voters deciding to vote Leave to keep \"our money\" and to reduce immigration, the price of membership of the single market would be unacceptably high. That leaves a \"bespoke\" solution, one based on the Swiss Model (pun intended), one where the UK negotiates a series of deals with the EU covering different industries.This is what Switzerland has done and it is a very prosperous country, but it does raise several areas of concern for the financial services industry in the UK. For a start, the City will want a better deal than the Swiss enjoy. The perfect illustration of that is the fact that one of the reasons the City is so successful is that it has attracted all those banks to London to do business in the EU, including all the major Swiss ones. That\\\'s because Switzerland\\\'s deal with EU does not provide its banks with that \"passport\" the UK enjoys, so they have to base a lot of their staff here. A great gain for our economy and a bit of blow for the Swiss economy. It also illustrates why these deals are going to be so important and need to be negotiated very carefully, not to mention with a will of steel. The financial services industry employs more than two million people in this country and it pays more in taxes to the government than any other sector of the economy. It is therefore an industry that other rival financial centres would like to get their hands on - places such as Paris, Frankfurt and Amsterdam, for instance.

That\\\'s what we\\\'d have to move in to,\" says Penny.Now it\\\'s being claimed that millions of working renters could find themselves in a similar position.A report out this week warned there are large gaps in the Housing Benefit safety net - leaving the majority of Britain\\\'s 7.7 million renters at risk of losing their homes, should their income drop significantly.More than five million working adults would not qualify for full Housing Benefit if they lost their job, according to the report by Royal London insurance.The benefit is also known as Local Housing Allowance (LHA) for those renting in the private sector.The report identifies four groups who are particularly vulnerable:\"Unless they are able to resume paid work quickly, 5.5 million working renters would be at risk of not being able to pay the rent, and having to move to cheaper accommodation,\" said Steve Webb, director of policy at Royal London, and a former pensions minister.Use Penny and Rich fit into three of the \"at risk\" groups above.Penny\\\'s part-time income counts against them when it comes to their entitlement.They have three grown-up children who are no longer living at home, so they are classed as having three spare bedrooms. Again this reduces their entitlement.And they rent in a relatively expensive area. Their Housing Benefit is worked out on the basis of the cheapest rents in Bristol. So they lose out further.Only this week a committee of MPs \"We\\\'re not trying to scrounge the system,\" says Penny.\"Nevertheless it would be nice to feel that because we\\\'ve paid into the system, we could have some support back when we\\\'re going through difficult times.\"A lot of other people are in the same situation.\"In response, the government said it was doing all it could to protect those who need help.\"We continue to spend around \\xc2\\xa390bn a year on working age benefits, including unemployment and sickness benefits, to ensure a strong safety net for the most vulnerable,\" said a spokesperson for the Department of Communities and Local Government.It said it was also working to produce a bigger private rented sector, including homes provided by companies.Lee Healey, the managing director of IncomeMAX, advises people experiencing a shortfall in Housing Benefit to apply for so-called These are financed by the government, which has given local authorities extra cash to mitigate the impact of benefit changes, such as the spare room subsidy and Universal Credit.\"There is a system of Discretionary Housing Payments available to vulnerable renters, but there is no guaranteed entitlement to them, and you have to apply,\" he says. \"Despite the pitfalls, it is still extremely important to apply for Housing Benefit - or the rent element of Universal Credit - and Discretionary Housing Payments if you need help with your rent.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37119403','2016-08-20 13:50:53','2016-08-20 04:32:35',1),(221,'Selfies fuel boom in make-up sales for Estee Lauder','Estee Launder\'s turnover grows as the selfie means that the snap-happy want to be camera ready at all times.','Some call it extreme narcissism, for others, it is just a bit of fun.

The Swede\\\'s movement was significant in a United attack that looks far livelier than it did under the management of Louis van Gaal last season.Intriguingly, Ibrahimovic appears to have bumped captain Wayne Rooney from penalty duties. He was quick to take on the responsibility when United were awarded a spot-kick; his finish was his 25th successful conversion from his last 28 attempts.His second debut for the club was delayed because of a suspension held over from his time in Italy but, with that served, manager Jose Mourinho tried to warn supporters against expecting too much too soon.The midfielder is still getting back to full speed, having been given a break after helping France reach the Euro 2016 final - and that showed in his performance.However, there was plenty of evidence to suggest that Mourinho was right to spend so much money to bring Pogba back to Old Trafford. His display was a positive one, with more touches and more passes in the opposing half than any team-mate.One surging run towards the end of the first half left four Southampton players in his wake, and demonstrated his power, while a second-half header from a Juan Mata corner flew just over the bar.He did fade as the match reached its later stages - undoubtedly a result of the fact that he has not had a proper pre-season - but the Frenchman summoned up enough energy to blast a shot wide at the end of a late counter-attack.A goal would have rounded off Pogba\\\'s night perfectly, but he was happy enough. For him, victory was the perfect way to celebrate the 26th birthday of his brother, Partick Thistle striker Mathias Pogba.Another summer has brought yet another squad overhaul at Southampton, with Sadio Mane, Graziano Pelle and Victor Wanyama all leaving the club, along with manager Ronald Koeman.Claude Puel, Koeman\\\'s replacement, is still finding his feet in the Premier League, and the same could be said of the reshaped squad he leads.The visitors had their moments at Old Trafford, with Shane Long going close and Dusan Tadic seeing a goal ruled out for a push moments before Ibrahimovic\\\'s decisive second.Losing midfielder Oriol Romeu to an early injury did not help them, but having won 1-0 on each of their last two visits to Old Trafford, they rarely looked likely to extend that run.Ibrahimovic was the star of Ligue 1 last season, scoring 50 goals in all competitions last season as Paris St-Germain completed a domestic clean sweep.His self-confidence has never been in question, but there were doubts as to whether he could be prolific in the Premier League at the age of 34. However, his fine start at Old Trafford has given United fans plenty of reason for cheer.\"I was relaxed, no nerves, I played my game. The first ball of the match, I lost it, but got used to it. After that, I felt better. \"I came here to win, that is what I always wanted. It\\\'s a top club. We need to get used to winning and carry on like this. We dream big.

But for the first time, famous figures in Turkey have joined the calls to raise awareness of Ms Kader\\\'s murder and to take part in a demonstration scheduled for Sunday evening in Istanbul. According to data from the rights group Transgender Europe, Turkey has the highest number of trans murders in Europe. But \"there is no safe country for trans people\" as the group\\\'s 2016 report observes.Ms Kader tried to call attention to trans murders in Turkey and the lack of justice. She was usually in the front at demonstrations. But it is perhaps the images of Hande Kader that have been shared innumerable times on social media that best explain the trans woman who is still waiting to be buried due to the processes of identification, post mortem, and DNA testing. In 2015, police had banned the annual LGBTI Pride march in Taksim Square in Istanbul. They tried to disperse the crowds, using water cannon, rubber bullets and pepper spray. But Ms Kader stood stubbornly against the police. She reproached journalists: \"You take pictures but you do not publish them. No-one is hearing our voices.\"Hande Kader\\\'s voice was silenced finally by murder, in a way no one would want to imagine: she was burned. She earned a living through sex work, always putting her safety at risk. Like other trans individuals forced into prostitution, she worked on the street. She sought a way out but could not find it. \"She did not like this work,\" her close friend Funda said, adding, \"but who would like it, anyway?\"The trans individuals I spoke to nearly all have stories about how they \"escaped death.\"Kemal Ordek is one of them. Ordek, who uses the gender-neutral pronouns \"they/their\", says they were \"lucky\" to survive an attack at home.  \"There are very few trans individuals who die of natural causes - nearly none,\" Ordek says. \"When you are pushed to sex work, it\\\'s not possible for people to reach old age. They are killed. I don\\\'t know how I survived. That\\\'s the sad part.\"Ordek, a sociology graduate, earns a living mainly through sex work and is also the president of Red Umbrella, an association that defends the rights of trans sex workers. \"We are viewed not as people who can integrate into society but as the dirt of society. What grabs our attention most when we are walking on the street are the looks that see us as sexual objects,\" Ordek says. \"When I first became an activist, I would not be able to sleep thinking about the kind of news I\\\'d get in the middle of the night,\" Ordek says. \"Even now, my phone is at the highest ringtone when I sleep at night. I wait for news: someone will be stabbed, someone beaten and I\\\'ll get called and I\\\'ll have to go there immediately. This is a never-ending mourning and state of trauma.\"The identity reassignment process for trans individuals in Turkey is long and painful. Many don\\\'t dare to start on it. Because of this, trans women can\\\'t change the [gendered] colour of their IDs and can\\\'t work in brothels where they might have more security. Sinem Hun, a lawyer who works closely on trans identity reassignment cases, says the state \"wants to see\" that both trans men and trans women have undergone surgery to their genitalia to establish that the gender reassignment process has taken place physically. At the same time, she says, sterilisation is mandatory. \"There are trans individuals who cannot change their identity for five or six years,\" says Ms Hun. Very few doctors are qualified to carry out these operations, a difficult and expensive process in Turkey. The struggle to stay alive in Turkey where trans individuals are pushed to the margins or cities, as well as the struggle to prove their existence, comes to life in a sentence that is repeated, emphasised, written at every demonstration: \"Don\\\'t be silent, shout, trans exist.\"For trans individuals, the struggles for social acceptance and to stay alive are one. Legal processes and democratic wins may determine when they will be equal citizens in Turkey and other countries, but trans, LGBTI individuals and their allies hope that Hande Kader will be a turning point in the response to trans murders.

Mr Patel represents continuity and a safe pair of hands.Outgoing governor Raghuram Rajan was one of the world\\\'s most well-known central bankers. The new man has less of a global reputation but enough credentials that international investors - so key to India\\\'s economic growth - are unlikely to be worried.And the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, which has been agonising over this decision for a while, is likely to feel comfortable too. Mr Rajan riled some politicians for weighing into debates seen as being outside the role of a central bank governor - be that tolerance among different religions or the lavish lifestyle of indebted businessmen. Mr Patel will be expected to be lower-key and more conventional. This is a nation whose food prices can fluctuate widely, often depending on the weather. And for hundreds of millions of Indians being able to afford basic vegetables and pulses is a major concern.However, in a recent interview with the BBC, Mr Rajan denied having ever been publicly critical of Mr Modi\\\'s government.Mr Patel takes charge at a time when India has the fastest-growing major economy in the world and its currency, the rupee  - which hit record lows in 2013 - is more stable. And while there have been concerns about inflation rates creeping up as oil prices recover and food costs rise, many expect the central bank to cut interest rates later this year to help stimulate more growth.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37148102','2016-08-21 22:14:06','2016-08-21 16:37:43',1),(248,'Australian rules spectator banned after throwing banana at Aboriginal player','A female fan filmed throwing a banana at an Aboriginal Australian rules player is banned by her club.','A female fan filmed throwing a banana at an Aboriginal Australian rules player has been banned by her club.The Port Adelaide Power spectator aimed the banana at Adelaide Crows\\\' Eddie Betts after he celebrated scoring a goal in the game at Adelaide\\\'s Oval.Port Adelaide have banned her \"indefinitely\" after deciding her actions breached their code of conduct.\"It is clear that the offender\\\'s behaviour was racially motivated,\" said a Footage on social media appeared to show the fan pick up the banana and throw it in the direction of Betts, before his team-mate Josh Jenkins intercepted it.The woman will be invited to take part in Power\\\'s Aboriginal cultural awareness programmes, the club said.The statement added that as part of this programme, \"the club\\\'s seven Aboriginal players would educate her on cultural issues that continue to have an impact on the Aboriginal community today and the hurt which actions such as hers cause others.\"A Crows statement from chief executive Andrew Fagan said: \"There is no place in our game or society for such abhorrent behaviour.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/37148091','2016-08-21 22:14:06','2016-08-21 22:16:37',1),(249,'Afghan troops \'retake Kunduz district from Taliban\'','Afghan government forces have pushed the Taliban back from a key northern district near Kunduz, the provincial governor says.','Afghan government forces have recaptured a key district of the northern province of Kunduz from the Taliban, the provincial governor says.Asadullah Omarkhel\\\'s announcement came hours after Khanabad district was seized by Taliban fighters.But local sources told the BBC that Taliban fighters were still present near the district headquarters.

There is no doubt that one of the talking points of the Rio Games has been China\\\'s performance. The country lies third in In events in which it is traditionally strong - such as gymnastics - China performed miserably, and fell short in swimming and badminton too.So what has gone wrong? I look at it another way: the very fact we are asking this question shows just how far China has come.After decades of political wrangling, China finally participated fully in the world\\\'s greatest sporting spectacle.At home in Beijing, we had got our first colour TV, which became a focal point for the whole family as we watched the Chinese sporting heroes competing with some of the best in the world.When Xu Haifeng won China\\\'s first ever Olympic gold medal, in pistol shooting, it was hailed as a  \"great breakthrough\" and the whole nation celebrated.  China went on to win 15 gold, eight silver and nine bronze medals at those Games, finishing fourth in the medal table. Gymnast Li Ning, with three gold, two silver and one bronze medal, became an instant celebrity.  I still remember the women\\\'s volleyball final with the USA. China were already world champions and the players were household names.They had lost to the USA in the preliminary round, but beat the USA 3-0 in the final. The match was tense, made worse by my over-enthusiastic neighbour, who constantly shouted out latest scores through his window for all to hear.It was a time of great optimism, not only for sport, but for China\\\'s development too, as the country finally shook off the shadow of the Cultural Revolution and embarked on reform.What\\\'s more, China\\\'s presence at the 1984 Games made the world sit up and notice.China was not able to replicate the feat four years later in Seoul, managing only 11th place in the medal table, with five gold, 11 silver and 12 bronze medals.  This was partly blamed on the strong performance of the Soviet bloc countries, back from their Olympic boycott.But for a lot of people, the Seoul Games were remembered for one person: Ben Johnson, the Canadian sprinter who tested positive for a banned substance after he came first in the 100m final.I was studying at the University of Toronto and witnessed first-hand the shock of the nation as euphoria turned to nightmare. I became aware of the issue of doping in sport for the first time, not anticipating that China was soon to have its own doping scandals.At the 1994 Asian Games in Hiroshima, Japan, 11 Chinese athletes tested positive for steroids - seven of them swimmers, including world champions. They were stripped of their medals and banned for two years.About the same time, a group of female long-distance runners caught the world\\\'s attention. Coached by Ma Junren, these athletes consistently broke Chinese, Asian and world records, accumulating three gold medals in the 1993 World Athletic Championships and one gold in the Atlanta Olympic Games in 1996.In 2000, most of Ma\\\'s runners failed blood tests and were banned from the Sydney Games that year. Early in 2016, a letter reportedly written by leading runner Wang Junxia and nine others, came to light, with detailed revelations about how Ma had forced them to take drugs to boost their performance. The International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), which governs athletics, has indicated it will investigate the matter.These episodes and others seriously tarnished China\\\'s image. Despite a crackdown and an improved testing regime, the battle is far from won - as shown by swimmer Chen Xinyi, who was forced to leave Rio after testing positive for performance-enhancing drugs.In 2008, Beijing hosted the Olympic Games, a matter of tremendous national pride. Politics and sport had never been so closely linked.China wanted to showcase not only its sporting ability, but also how the country had been transformed by three decades of opening up and reform.The Beijing Games divided opinion perhaps more than any other in post-war history, and as a journalist working in London, I have to admit I breathed a sigh of relief when they were finally over.In sporting terms, China scored a great victory by coming top of the medal table, taking home advantage to the full.By now, China was a recognised global sporting power. But things were not perfect. China\\\'s only medal hope in athletics, hurdler Liu Xiang, pulled out of the race due to injury, and the lack of transparency surrounding his injuries angered his fans and raised questions about commercial pressures put on elite athletes.Liu Xiang almost repeated the fiasco during the London Games four years later, this time crashing out at the first hurdle. His agonising pain was for all to see, but he managed to hop with one foot to the finishing line, to huge applause by a very appreciative crowd.Other competitors showed class, too, by praising his spirit, one of the most heart-warming moments of the London Games.  Now, back to Rio. What has gone wrong with China\\\'s sportsmen and women?One explanation offered is the lack of new, world-class talent. I watched some gymnastic competitions on TV and I have to admit that, compared with others, Chinese gymnasts lacked power and artistry. But there might be other reasons.Compared with 1984, when winning a gold medal was a political task and a patriotic duty, or with 2008, when more medals meant more national pride, we are seeing a more relaxed attitude.While people still like to see China doing well, it perhaps no longer carries the importance it once did - although we have seen our share of soul-searching. \"As long as you gave your all, you\\\'re already a winner\", Chinese netizens told bronze medallist Fu Yuanhui, who Could it also be that China, the world\\\'s second largest economy and more confident on the international stage, no longer needs to take winning in a sport event, however noble and inspiring, so seriously?Who knows? Perhaps a more relaxed approach will help China produce more medals in the future.

A haul of five goals in La Liga last season meant his £100,000-a-week wages would be a gamble for newly promoted Boro.But a goal on his debut against Stoke was followed by another key performance. He set up the opener for Stuani, although the goal was very much of the Uruguayan\\\'s own making as he smashed home from distance.Negredo only assisted three goals in 40 games for Valencia last season, but had his second of the day when he could have gone alone. The 31-year-old Spain striker had space to shoot but instead, with goalkeeper Vito Mannone braced to attempt a save, Negredo rolled it across to Stuani to fire home.Sunderland boss Moyes decided to start with Paddy McNair, usually a defender, in midfield alongside Jack Rodwell. And when they needed a tactical reshuffle following an injury to centre-back John O\\\'Shea, it was Rodwell, rather than McNair who dropped back to defence.But when Moyes scrapped that experiment at half-time and replaced McNair with midfielder Jeremain Lens, they made a game of it.After the break they had more shots (14-3), more possession and more passes - having been behind on all of those counts in the first half.But with 34-year-old debutant Steven Pienaar the only Sunderland player other than Jermain Defoe to have more than 10 Premier League goals in his career, they rarely looked like scoring - with the exception of Van Aanholt\\\'s goal.\"We played well, we had a great level of intensity but ran out with 10 minutes to go.

The charge carries a jail term of up to two years. About two thirds of Malaysians are Muslim, though the country also has significant Buddhist, Christian and Hindu populations.

The death toll rose to 54 on Monday.The suicide bomber himself was a child aged 12-14, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has said.Mr Erdogan has blamed so-called Islamic State (IS) for the attack.Gaziantep, near the Syrian border, is known to contain several IS cells.One woman lost four children in the attack, the Haberturk newspaper reported. Emine Arhan told the title \"if it wasn\\\'t for my only surviving child, I would have killed myself\".Another victim was a nine-year-old girl who had stayed on at the party to see the bride after her parents had left, according to the Vatan newspaper.A disproportionately large number of women and children were killed in the attack because it targeted henna night, a part of the celebration attended mainly by women and children, says BBC Monitoring\\\'s Turkey analyst Pinar Sevinclidir.On Monday, Turkish officials were awaiting the results of DNA tests as they tried to identify the suicide attacker, the Hurriyet newspaper said.It added that the type of bomb, which contained scraps of metal, was similar to those used in previous attacks on pro-Kurdish gatherings.Kurdish fighters, backed by the US-led coalition, have been at the forefront of the fight against IS in Syria.We don\\\'t yet know the nationality of the attacker - Syrian, Turkish or other - but his generation has grown up formed by the Syrian conflict which tore away his childhood innocence and instilled in him the desire to kill.There is still no official claim of responsibility for the attack but the group calling itself Islamic State remains the prime suspect. The group is facing the loss of territory close to the Turkish border at the hands of Kurdish forces in Manbij and also a potential operation in Jarablus by the Free Syria Army - this could be an attempt to hit back. It\\\'s also a reminder that their cells are still active in Turkey and they can strike with devastating impact. Prosecutors said a search was also under way for two people believed to have accompanied the suspected attacker to the wedding party but who left before the blast.In a defiant speech on Monday, Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu said IS should be \"completely cleansed\" from the border area with Turkey. He was speaking amid reports that Turkish-backed Syrian rebels were preparing to try to seize the IS-held border town of Jarablus.The death toll from the bombing rose to 54 after three critically injured people died in hospital early on Monday. Thirteen of those killed were women, Turkish media said. Sixty-six people are still in hospital, 14 of them in a serious condition, Dogan news agency reported.There were emotional scenes as dozens of funerals for victims took place on Sunday. Some distraught relatives threw themselves on to the coffins.The explosion happened as wedding guests danced in the street on Saturday evening in a predominantly Kurdish district of Gaziantep.The pro-Kurdish Peoples\\\' Democratic Party (HDP), said the wedding had been for one of its members.The bride and bridegroom, from the mainly Kurdish region of Siirt in the south-east, survived the blast but were among the injured.Witness Veli Can, 25, said that the celebrations were coming to an end when the explosion ripped through a crowd of people dancing.\"There was blood and body parts everywhere,\" he said.Mr Erdogan said IS had been trying to \"position itself\" in Gaziantep, which is a major hub for Syrian refugees.

His campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said the mass deportation plan, which was a central plank of his campaign, was yet \"to be determined\".Her comments at the weekend came after Mr Trump met with a new panel of Hispanic advisers.He told Fox News on Monday he was not \"flip-flopping\" but wanted a fair plan.The businessman is scheduled to deliver a speech on immigration in Colorado on Thursday. Mr Trump has taken a hardline stance on immigration since the beginning of his campaign, vowing to create a \"deportation force\" as well as make Mexico pay for the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. While struggling to keep up with Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the polls, Mr Trump has addressed black and Hispanic voters in recent days with the aim of broadening his support beyond white working-class voters.\"What he supports is to make sure we enforce the law, that we are respectful of those Americans who are looking for jobs, and that we are fair and humane to those who live among us,\" Ms Conway told CNN on Sunday. When asked to clarify if Mr Trump would maintain his position on creating a deportation force, Ms Conway responded: \"To be determined.\"Donald Trump has repeatedly said the 11.4 million undocumented immigrants in the US \"have to go\". Now he may be wavering on that demand. The political risks of such a move - detractors will call it a flip-flop - are enormous. It will be difficult for Mr Trump to convince Hispanic voters and moderates that his change of heart is authentic. Meanwhile, Mr Trump\\\'s core base of support could feel betrayed.The Republican nominee has survived sometimes contradictory positions - on issues such as gay rights, abortion and the minimum wage - that allow supporters to pick and choose what they think he believes.His position on illegal immigration, however, is different. It\\\'s a central part of his argument that the US working class has been grievously wounded by economic policies implemented by a globalist elite more concerned with profit margins than American jobs. A reversal here would be akin to his saying that maybe Nafta isn\\\'t so bad after all. It would tear at the heart of his message. Given that Mr Trump\\\'s standing with Hispanics - particularly in key battleground states - has been an anchor on his presidential hopes, however, it may be a gamble he\\\'s decided to take.But Mr Trump\\\'s running mate, Mike Pence, insisted on Monday that the plan remains unchanged.\"I don\\\'t think the message is changing at all. I think people are just getting to know Donald Trump better,\" Mr Pence said.Mrs Clinton\\\'s campaign later released a statement saying there would be little revision to his immigration plan despite Ms Conway\\\'s suggestions.\"Donald Trump\\\'s immigration plan remains the same as it\\\'s always been - tear apart families and deport 16 million people from the United States,\" said campaign chair John Podesta.If the deportation plan is dropped or refashioned, it would not be the first shift in Mr Trump\\\'s immigration policy.His controversial plan to issue a \"total and complete shutdown\" of Muslims entering the country changed to a ban on countries with a history of terrorism against the US. That switch followed questions raised by constitutional experts.Last week, the Trump campaign faced a dramatic overhaul with the exit of campaign chairman Paul Manafort as well as the hiring of Breitbart News boss Stephen Bannon as CEO and Ms Conway as campaign manager.

The proposal had been to give all girls at Springhead Park Approved School in Rothwell, which cared for 14 and 15-year-olds, Haloperidol, a powerful sedative now used largely as an anti-psychotic.Approved Schools were on a level between between a children\\\'s home and Borstal.  While children were usually sent there by juvenile courts, they were not imprisoned; the sites were funded and inspected by the Home Office and run by voluntary organisations. The National Archives files feature discussions about the plans for the drug trials from three doctors who are all now deceased.In a document dating from late 1967, Dr JR Hawkings, a psychiatrist attached to Richmond Hill, wrote to the Home Office asking permission to conduct a drug trial on boys who were \"impulsive, explosive, irritable, restless and aggressive\". He wanted to give some of them a drug called Beclamide. The anticonvulsant, which has sedative effects and was prescribed for epilepsy, is no longer widely in use.Although Dr Hawkings said this would be \"a perfectly normal and legitimate therapy for certain types of disturbed adolescent\", he also said that it had not been widely tested on such boys. It was to be a \"double blind\" trial, with a control group given a placebo, and another group given the drug.But there is no indication that the trial was discussed or explained to participants, or any suggestion that their consent was sought.The papers show Home Office psychiatrist Dr Pamela Mason welcomed Dr Hawkings\\\'s plan. On 1 November 1967 she wrote: \"From the clinical or practical point of view these are the boys that can produce considerable problems within a school and this sort of research into possible drug treatment is to be welcomed... \"I would recommend maximum support for this project.\" According to notes on the file, the trial went ahead in 1968, with boys given the drug for six months. There is no record of the outcome in the documents, nor could I find any published paper in medical journals.And the files show the school headmaster told the Home Office that \"in view of assurances from the school doctor, from Dr Hawkings\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 and from the doctor acting for the manufacturers, the managers had decided that there was no need to consult the parents\".Bob Hammal, a teacher at Richmond Hill between 1968 and 1972, was appalled to learn of the trial.  He remembered there were challenges - but generally recalls a good relationship between staff and the boys.  \"What really did shock me more than anything was that parental consent was not sought and was not thought to be necessary by the powers-that-be,\" he said.He believes that had he, or other colleagues, known at the time, they would have tried to stop it, or acted as a whistleblower if that was not possible.As the Richmond Hill trial got under way, a second trial was proposed, again by a school psychiatrist, at Springhead Park Approved School for girls in Rothwell near Leeds.This was a sister school to the better known Duncroft in Surrey, a small institution for girls of higher intelligence. In November 1968, Dr Joyce Galbraith wrote to Dr Mason at the Home Office \"in strict confidence\". She said she was increasingly concerned about the tone of the school and unrest amongst the staff. To calm the situation, she suggested giving Haloperidol to every girl in the school, for 18 weeks. She wrote: \"My suggestion is that we should try some form of drug trial to see if, by allaying the anxiety of the girls chemically, we might perhaps settle the school a little bit more, and give the staff an opportunity to put their own house in order\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\"Again, Dr Mason supported the plan.The papers in the the National Archives show she wrote: \"I think this sounds a valuable treatment approach to the very real problems that arise from the special nature of girls in residence and in particular the problems presented by younger immature disturbed adolescent girls.\"The files also show that Shelagh Sunner, headmistress of the school between 1966 and 1982, did not support the trial.Speaking to the BBC about the National Archives material, she said drugs were not the solution for \"her\" girls.\"They weren\\\'t mentally sick kids\" she said. \"They needed to work through their emotions.\"The trial did not take place after the school\\\'s managers blocked it, worried about what the girls\\\' parents would think. Ms Sunner said she was not surprised, though, that the Home Office endorsed it. \"I think they were scratching their head about what they were going to do with this generation of maladjusted kids - because the approved schools were full and there were a lot of them.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37149029','2016-08-22 23:38:05','2016-08-22 07:46:40',1),(368,'PFI schools built in Scotland \'owned by offshore firms\'','More than 200 schools built in Scotland under private finance schemes are at least partially owned by offshore investment funds, BBC Scotland finds.','More than 200 schools built in Scotland under private finance initiative (PFI) schemes are now at least partially owned by offshore investment funds.Under PFI, the private sector builds and manages school buildings in return for a fee, typically over 25-30 years. In one project in Edinburgh, 17 new schools were built, with the council paying \\xc2\\xa31.5m a month. Analysis for the BBC found there had been 13 trades involving equity in the Edinburgh schools scheme since 2001. Although published data does not confirm the exact number of PFI schools owned wholly or partly offshore, it is clear they represent the vast majority.Stakes in PFI building projects can be sold. They can then be traded on the secondary market to become parts of larger investment funds and pensions, as the monthly fees paid by councils provide a steady income.Dexter Whitfield, from the European Services Strategy Unit, told a BBC Scotland investigation the Edinburgh PPP1 scheme was now owned by four different companies. \"Those four different companies are located offshore in Guernsey and Jersey, and they are basically controlled by shareholders,\" he said.A critic of PFI, he has described the projects as \"wealth machines\", adding: \"There are an awful lot of people making very substantial sums of money out of it.\"The 17 schools built in Edinburgh under PPP1  were closed for repairs earlier this year after construction faults were found.The problems - with wall and header ties, used to hold exterior and interior walls together and attach them to the rest of the building -  first became apparent when About 7,600 primary and secondary school children in the capital were eventually affected.An independent inquiry into the matter will consider whether the private finance method contributed to the structural issues with the buildings.The City of Edinburgh Council said the schools would be safe and well-maintained for as long as the contract is in place. Andrew Kerr, the chief executive of City of Edinburgh Council, said the terms of the contract ensured that schools are kept in a good condition. \"That\\\'s something that was decided 10, 15 years ago.

Ireland President Pat Hickey being arrested while wearing his bath robe will overshadow all the country\\\'s sporting performances in Rio.Looking more specifically at the Northern Ireland angle, with 20 competitors representing Team Ireland and eight in action for Team GB, a return of no medals has to be regarded as a disappointment after the four-medal haul in London.But this bald statistic requires some more examination.London 2012 bronze medallists Paddy Barnes and Michael Conlan were really the only two Northern Irish hopefuls who could have been termed as medal bankers heading into Rio.Barnes\\\' shock exit in the light-flyweight division was a further devastating blow to an Irish boxing team already reeling after news of middleweight Years of battling to make the 49 kilogram light-flyweight limit finally appeared to catch up with the hugely popular Barnes as he was visibly blowing early on against unheralded Spaniard Samuel Carmona.After the contest, Barnes claimed that he had weighed as much as 58 kilos only six weeks before the contest and the light-flyweight\\\'s battle with the scales will surely warrant a mention in the Irish Athletic Boxing Association\\\'s post-Rio review.But while Barnes was clearly not himself in his one Rio contest, his great friend Michael Conlan was the victim of a Victory would have guaranteed Conlan at least a bronze medal but with a tough semi-final task against American talent Shakur Stevenson in advance of a possible final meeting with eventual winner Cuban Robeisy Ramirez.Both fights would have represented no easy task.However, Conlan was clearly \"robbed\" of a medal which would have put a markedly different slant on the province\\\'s Rio efforts given that only 17 medals have been won in Northern Ireland\\\'s Olympic history since John McNally\\\'s opening boxing silver in 1952.In terms of Northern Ireland\\\'s other boxers, After winning a silver and bronze in London, there was hope of more Northern Ireland rowing success in Rio from the Coleraine trio of Alan Campbell and the Chambers brothers Richard and Peter.However after a build-up affected by health issues and poor form, 2012 bronze medallist Campbell, 33, was always likely to face a tough task in the single sculls and his failure to make the final was, in truth, not a major surprise.Unlike 2012, the Chambers brothers did not race together in Rio as both Peter and Richard exited in the lightweight four and lightweight double sculls semi-finals stage.Peter did not appear unduly surprised by the British duo\\\'s failure to

squad which included Gleghorne\\\'s brother Paul and six other Ulstermen will depart Rio with their reputation enhanced as they narrowly missed out on a last-eight spot after a closing 3-2 group

Once considered one of the world\\\'s \"fragile five\" economies, India is now among the fastest-growing.Vishnu Varathan from Mizuho Bank believes that \"political agenda and vested interest\" usurped economic sensibility in India and that Mr Rajan should not have been let go before serving a second term.\"Extending the tenure of central bankers is ordinarily a given, and justifiably so, in view of long lags in monetary policy transmission alongside the need to manage policy through business cycles,\" he told the BBC.\"Opting to let Rajan\\\'s term expire risks being construed as a politically motivated move to rein in central bankers with an independent streak not aligned with the establishment - a perception reinforced by public criticisms of Rajan by politicians.\"So can Mr Patel live up to Raghuram Rajan\\\'s legacy?Most accounts of Mr Patel have described him as a well-respected but \"low-key\" and \"solitary\" figure.India\\\'s Economic Times newspaper headlined his promotion as The pun, of course, being that economic commentators like to label policymakers as either a \"hawk\", who focuses on issues like clamping down on inflation, or a \"dove\", who looks to create more jobs.They\\\'re opposites in the media but very much in tune with policy, Stephen Innes, a senior trader at currency broker Oanda, told the BBC.\"People tend to focus on Rajan\\\'s rock star or celebrity status but in fact, his hawkish stance and determined focus on inflation, while not winning many friends in political circles, in itself was a success story.\"Urjit Patel is cut from the same policy cloth and represents continuity in that regard. To that degree, the markets will likely price out much further easing possibilities in the near term.\"However, some analysts say Mr Patel has a \"higher and harder\" bar to clear.His biggest challenge will be tackling rural inflation, an old and stubborn foe, while trying to deal with uneven growth.Consumer price inflation is currently running at more than 6%, which is above the government target of 4%, as higher oil prices feed into the economy.\"We think that Patel will make his own mark,\" Mizuho Bank\\\'s Vishnu Varathan said. \"He is seen as the key architect of the inflation-targeting regime he is taking over, rather than inheriting it passively.\"Major changes are scheduled to take place at the RBI under Mr Patel\\\'s watch, most notably, how interest rate decisions are made.Formerly the remit of one man - the governor - policy changes will now be under the purview of a six-person committee.But being seen as apolitical will help Mr Patel, argues Mr Varathan.\"A more policy-focused approach to extracting fiscal discipline will also allow him to establish his position as a central banker who engaged fiscal authorities without succumbing or agitating unnecessarily.\"The upshot is that Patel needs to be less concerned about emerging from Rajan\\\'s shadow and perhaps more on standing his ground.

The main criticism is that public money is used to support jobs that were being created anyway.It would appear that ministers are also now convinced that the private sector needs less support than it has in the past.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-politics-37153531','2016-08-22 23:38:05','2016-08-22 21:19:25',1),(408,'Boys playing chicken with Porthcawl waves \'unsafe\'','Two teenage boys who played chicken with large waves during stormy weather in south Wales are lucky to be alive, the Coastguard says.','Two teenage boys who played chicken with large waves during stormy weather in south Wales are lucky to be alive, the Coastguard has said.The pair were seen dodging seawater as waves hit the breakwater at Porthcawl as it got dark on Sunday.Phil Norman, duty controller for the UK Coastguard, said the images were \"alarming\".People have been urged to avoid rough seas after \"The seas have been unforgiving this weekend and we cannot stress enough that piers, rocks, harbours and the water\\\'s edge are not safe places to be when the weather is bad,\" Mr Norman said.   \"Playing chicken with waves is extremely dangerous.

Headlined simply Hiroshima, the 30,000-word article by John Hersey had a massive impact, revealing the full horror of nuclear weapons to the post-war generation, as Caroline Raphael describes.I have an original copy of the 31 August 1946 edition of The New Yorker.  It has the most innocuous of covers - a delightful playful carefree drawing of summer in a park. On the back cover, the managers of the New York Giants and the New York Yankees encourage you to \"Always Buy Chesterfield\" cigarettes.  Past the Goings on About Town and movie listings, past the ritzy adverts for diamonds and fur and cars and cruises you find a simple statement from The Editors explaining that this edition will be devoted entirely to just one article \"on the almost complete obliteration of a city by one atomic bomb\". They are taking this step, they say, \"in the conviction that few of us have yet comprehended the all but incredible destructive power of this weapon, and that everyone might well take time to consider the terrible implications of its use\". Seventy years ago no-one talked about stories \"going viral\", but the publication of John Hersey\\\'s article Hiroshima in The New Yorker achieved just that.  It was talked of, commented on, read and listened to by many millions all over the world as they began to understand what really happened not just to the city but to the people of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 and in the following days.   It was spring 1946 when John Hersey, decorated war correspondent and prize-winning novelist, was commissioned by The New Yorker to go to Hiroshima. He expected to write, as others had done, a piece about the state of the shattered city, the buildings, the rebuilding, nine months on. On the voyage out he fell ill and was given a copy of Thornton Wilders\\\'s The Bridge of San Luis Rey. Inspired by Wilder\\\'s narrative of the five people who crossed the bridge as it collapsed he decided he would write about people not buildings. And it was that simple decision that marks Hiroshima out from other pieces of the time.  Once in Hiroshima he found survivors of the bomb whose stories he would tell, starting from the minutes before the bomb was dropped. Many years later he told of the horror he felt, how he could only stay a few weeks.  Hersey took these accounts back to New York. Had he filed from Japan the chances of them ever being published would have been remote - previous attempts to get graphic photographs or film or reports out of the country had been halted by the US Occupying Forces. The material had been censored or locked away - sometimes it simply disappeared. Hersey\\\'s editors, Harold Ross and William Shawn, knew they had something quite extraordinary, unique, and the edition was prepared in utter secrecy.  Never before had all the magazine\\\'s editorial space been given over to a single story and it has never happened since. Journalists who were expecting to have their stories in that week\\\'s edition wondered where their proofs had gone. Twelve hours before publication, copies were sent to all the major US newspapers - a smart move that resulted in editorials urging everyone to read the magazine.All 300,000 copies immediately sold out and the article was reprinted in many other papers and magazines the world over, except where newsprint was rationed. When Albert Einstein attempted to buy 1,000 copies of the magazine to send to fellow scientists he had to contend with facsimiles.  The US Book of the Month Club gave a free special edition to all its subscribers because, in the words of its president, \"We find it hard to conceive of anything being written that could be of more important at this moment to the human race.\"  Within two weeks a second-hand copy of The New Yorker sold for 120 times its cover price.  If Hiroshima demonstrates anything as a piece of journalism it is the enduring power of storytelling. John Hersey combined all his experience as a war correspondent with his skill as a novelist.  It was a radical piece of journalism that gave a vital voice to those who only a year before had been mortal enemies. There in a cataclysmic landscape of living nightmares, of the half-dead, of burnt and seared bodies, of desperate attempts to care for the blasted survivors, of hot winds and a flattened city ravaged by fires we meet Miss Sasaki , the Rev Mr Tanimoto, Mrs Nakamura and her children, the Jesuit Father Kleinsorge and doctors Fujii and Sasaki.      Orientals had been demonised long before Pearl Harbor. The Yellow Peril of the cartoon strips had sunk deep into the American psyche.  In 1941 Time-Life ran an extraordinary article telling readers how they could tell Japanese from Chinese - \"How to tell your friends from the Japs\".  The pilot of the Enola Gay is reported to have said he felt like sci-fi hero Buck Rogers the day he dropped the bomb. So only a year after the end of the war these six close-ups on five Japanese men and women and one Westerner, each of whom \"saw more death than he ever thought he would see\" were unexpected and shattering. Readers who sent letters to The New Yorker, almost all in admiration for the work, wrote of their shame and horror that ordinary people, just like them - secretaries and mothers, doctors and priests - had endured such terror. John Hersey was not the first to report from Hiroshima but the reports and newsreels had been a blizzard of numbers too big to fully comprehend. They had reported on the destruction of the city, the mushroom cloud, the shadows of the dead on the walls and streets but never got close to those who lived through those end-of-days time, as Hersey did. It was also becoming increasingly clear to some that this new weapon carried on killing long after the \"noiseless flash\" as bright as the sun, despite intense government and military attempts to cover it up or deny it. Hiroshima was the first publication to make the man on the San Francisco trolleybus and the woman on the Clapham omnibus confront the miseries of radiation sickness, to understand that you could survive the bomb and still die from its after effects. John Hersey in his calm unflinching prose reported what those who had survived had witnessed.  As the nuclear arms race began, just three months after the testing of further atom bombs at Bikini Atoll, the true power of the new weapons began to be understood.  Such were the reverberations of Hersey\\\'s article, and Albert Einstein\\\'s very public support for it, that Henry Stimson who had been US Secretary for War wrote a magazine article in reply, The Decision to Use the Atomic Bomb - a defiant justification for the use of the bomb, whatever the consequences.  News of the extraordinary article had been reported in Britain, but it was too long to publish - John Hersey would not allow it to be edited and newsprint was still rationed.  So the BBC followed American radio\\\'s lead and about six weeks later it was read out over four consecutive nights on the new Third Programme, despite some concern among senior managers about the emotional impact on listeners. The Radio Times commissioned Alistair Cooke to write a long background piece. Alluding to its publication in The New Yorker, renowned as the home of witty cartoons, he called it \"the deadliest joke of our age\".The listening figures were high and the BBC decided to rebroadcast the reading on the Light Programme all in one go, just a few weeks later, to make sure even more people heard it. That\\\'s the Light Programme whose remit was, according to the BBC Handbook for that year, \"to entertain its listeners and to interest them in the world at large without failing to be entertaining\".  There was little to entertain in this two-hour programme.  The Daily Express critic, Nicholas Hallam, called it the most terrifying broadcast he had ever heard. The BBC had also invited John Hersey to be interviewed and his cabled reply is in the BBC archives: \"Hersey gratefullest invitation and BBC interest and coverage Hiroshima but has throughout maintained policy let story speak for itself without additional words from himself or anybody.\" Indeed, Hersey was only to give three or four interviews his entire life. Sadly not one of them was for the BBC.   A 1948 recording of a reading of Hiroshima remains in the BBC archives. The effect of the crisp English voices telling this harrowing story is startling. The prose is revealed as rhythmic and often quietly poetic and ironic.  One of the readers is the young actress Sheila Sim, newly married at the time to the actor Richard Attenborough.By November, Hiroshima was published in book form. It was translated quickly into many languages and a braille edition was released. However, in Japan, Gen Douglas MacArthur - the supreme commander of occupying forces, who effectively governed Japan until 1948 - had strictly prohibited dissemination of any reports on the consequences of the bombings. Copies of the book, and the relevant edition of The New Yorker, were banned until 1949, when Hiroshima was finally translated into Japanese by the Rev Mr Tanimoto, one of Hersey\\\'s six survivors.Hersey never forgot his survivors. In 1985, on the 40th anniversary of the bomb, he went back to Japan and wrote The Aftermath, the story of what had happened to them in the intervening four decades.  Two of them had since died, one of them certainly from radiation-related disease.

Last October a 13-year-old girl, Sheridan Hookimaw, headed to the rubbish dump and hanged herself. Since then more than 100 of Attawapiskat\\\'s 2,000 First Nation people, most of them teenagers, but one just 11 years old, have attempted suicide. Jackie Hookimaw, a Cree native of Attawapiskat, a teacher, and Sheridan\\\'s aunt offers to show me around. We set off down a dirt track past wooden cabins with boats and tepees in the backyard. A teenage boy is loading containers on to a quad bike outside a shed.  \"That\\\'s the water treatment plant,\" says Jackie. \"It\\\'s the only place to get drinking water. The stuff that comes out of the tap is so toxic folks won\\\'t shower in it, let alone drink it. We get everything here from rashes to cancers.\"The track takes us to a sports hall. There\\\'s a makeshift gym, dumbbells, a couple of weight machines and a fug of stale sweat.  I meet 19-year-old Skylar Hookimaw, his brow furrowed, biceps straining. Sheridan was his little sister. \"It still doesn\\\'t feel real, like it didn\\\'t happen, but it did,\" he sighs. There\\\'s a heavy silence. \"Why is it happening so often?\" I ask.  \"Family problems, bullying, drugs, alcohol,\" says Skylar. \"Kids feel like they\\\'ve been left alone, like they don\\\'t matter.\"  Back in April, 11 youngsters tried to kill themselves over the course of one weekend. The day before I arrived, a teenage girl slashed her wrists and had to be airlifted out. The week before, an \"at risk\" boy tried to hang himself.  Jackie takes me out on a canoe on the Attawapiskat River. Her people have fished here, hunted goose and caribou, for countless generations. We glide past four girls playing in the water, diving, splashing, shrieking with laughter. \"You wouldn\\\'t know it, but those girls are struggling,\" says Jackie as she waves a greeting. \"Our young people are lost. They don\\\'t feel valued. They feel disconnected from their culture and they need help.\"      Help, claims Justin Trudeau, Canada\\\'s youthful premier, is on its way. He\\\'s promised a fresh start in Canada\\\'s relationship with its 1.4 million Aboriginal citizens. He pledged more money for their communities, a new focus on education and mental health in First Nation reserves like Attawapiskat. He\\\'s also launched an inquiry into another dark aspect of the indigenous experience in modern Canada - the shockingly disproportionate levels of violence directed against First Nation women. In the past 30 years more than 4,000 indigenous women have gone missing or been murdered.      Many of them fall through the cracks when they get to Canada\\\'s cities. The police, the courts, social services all have a shameful record of failure - failure to protect, to investigate, to prosecute and ultimately to care.  In prosperous Calgary, a western city grown rich on cattle and oil, I join a rain-soaked vigil to mark the death of 25-year-old Joey English. Her dismembered body was found in a city park in June. A couple of dozen friends join Stephanie and Patsy, Joey\\\'s mother and grandmother as they sing and drum and remember. \"It\\\'s like when you cut yourself and you can\\\'t control the flow of the blood, that\\\'s how I feel,\" says Stephanie. When Joey\\\'s grandmother speaks, the anger is raw. \"I\\\'m so pissed off with the justice system,\" she says. \"I\\\'m so tired of this. Our families, our sisters need help.\"Beyond the small circle of mourners, Calgary\\\'s streets are packed with revellers in the city for the annual Stampede - it\\\'s all Stetsons and cowboy boots and a celebration of Canada\\\'s Old West - the pioneers who settled a vast empty land. Except it wasn\\\'t empty. It was the land of the Blackfoot, the Kainai, the Cree and so many more. \"We were taught to be silent,\" says Sandra Manyfeathers, whose sister, Jacky Crazybull, was murdered during the Calgary Stampede nine years ago. \"But we\\\'re saying you\\\'re not gonna kick us, you\\\'re not gonna keep us down. No way are we gonna be quiet any more.\"  Each year, dozens of Canadian Aboriginal women are murdered or disappear never to be seen again. Some end up in a river that runs through the heart of Winnipeg. One of them was a 15-year-old school girl called Tina Fontaine, whose body was found in August 2014.

Stephen Smith, 55, sets out on a mission to answer these eternal questions.On his 80th birthday, the French statesman Clemenceau was taking the air on the Champs-Elysees with a friend when a beautiful young woman came towards them. As she passed by, Clemenceau turned to his companion and sighed, \"Oh, to be 70 again!\"There are only two subjects, according to the film director Peter Greenaway: sex and death. Put them together and you have the mid-life crisis. On the one hand, the waning of one\\\'s charms, vigour and fertility; on the other liver-spotted paw, the incessant susurrus of sand through Father Time\\\'s hourglass. Of course, we prefer to avert our thoughts from such elemental things, and tell ourselves that the mid-life crisis (MLC, for short) is about concerns like status and goals. I have a hunch that these are peripheral. The Oxford English Dictionary defines the MLC as a \"loss of self-confidence and feeling of anxiety or disappointment that can occur in early middle age\".  But when is that, exactly?Stephen Smith, above left, with septuagenarian socialite Nicky Haslam. Smith presents In Defence of the Mid-Life Crisis, on BBC Radio 4 at 10:30 BST, Saturday 20 August. Most authorities suggest it begins in the mid- to late-40s, though it\\\'s perhaps a state of mind more than a black letter day on an actuarial table. It struck former rugby league player Danny Lockwood when his hair began to desert him.\"I\\\'d had a mullet in the 80s and this came as a bit of a shock,\" says Lockwood, now in his 50s. He booked himself into a trichology clinic and emerged, he says, looking like Davy Crockett.\"I got through a meeting and thought \\\'This ain\\\'t right\\\'. So I went to the barber\\\'s and asked for a number one - had it all shaved off again. The wife never even saw it.\"Anyone who watches sitcom or romcoms will know men are typically the butt of MLC storylines. But the writer and journalist Miranda Sawyer recounts a by-no-means rare example of the distaff MLC. \"The strongest feeling I\\\'ve had was that I\\\'ve done it all wrong\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 I\\\'ve woken up in this life and it\\\'s not my life,\" says Sawyer, recounting the moment her mid-life crisis truly descended.  She had woken up one day, in her 40s, and felt her life \"should have been something different\".Sawyer has documented her experiences in a new book, Out of Time, and is candid enough to admit that mid-life sex can be a ticklish issue.  \"As you get older, there\\\'s a lot invested in your relationship with your partner and to ask them for more sex, different sex, less sex, better sex, becomes really, really hard.\"Nor is the phenomenon confined to the straight community.Broadcaster Simon Fanshawe, 59, detects what he calls the gay mid-life crisis when he spots a man d\\\'un age certain in unduly tight shorts.The MLC for gay men, he says, is inextricably bound up with coming out.Whether they like it or not, formerly settled married men who come out in their middle years reset their personal chronometers, says Fanshawe.\"One day they\\\'re fine and with the wife and children\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 six months later they\\\'ve come out and suddenly there\\\'s this tattooed leather queen coming down the road. Whatever age you actually come out, in your head you\\\'re 16. It\\\'s a kind of year-zero of being gay.\"You might be interested to know what a world-class philosopher has to say about the MLC, but Alain de Botton (46) wasn\\\'t available, so we had to settle for the late Arthur Schopenhauer instead.The views of this 19th Century German seer were outlined to me by Kieran Setiya, a philosophy professor who is writing a \"Schopenhauer\\\'s basic argument is that the problem with getting what you want is that your pursuit is over and then you have nothing to do,\" says Setiya. \"He thought we were doomed to swing endlessly between the boredom of having no desires, and the agony of having unsatisfied desires.\"Happily Schopenhauer managed to get out of the bed the right side one morning and acknowledged that although all desire was ultimately pointless he thought the pursuit of atelic activities, like going for a walk, seeing friends for a coffee, was less likely to lead to depression and futility I tried to have the best of both worlds, by inviting BBC director general Tony Hall to savour a cup of coffee with me while I leveraged an inflation-busting salary review, but I soon discovered Schopenhauer\\\'s iron laws weren\\\'t to be trifled with. Someone who gets that very well is former businessman turned stand-up comic Dave Streeter. He had it all, to coin a phrase: family, business, nice house. But then the business went, and pretty soon, so did everything else.  Streeter adapted the presentation skills he had learned at work into stage patter.\"My wife got the house, the car, the kids. I got the guilt and a four-man tent,\" he says. \"The tragedy is, I don\\\'t know four men that like camping.\"Like all the MLC veterans I met, Streeter looks back on it as a valuable if painful stocktaking. He introduced me to his new passion: vibing, a kind of disco on two wheels. Vibers work up a sweat on static bikes to the sound of club favourites. With the tang of scorched lycra in my nostrils, I reflected that vibing could be seen as a metaphor for the MLC: pedalling furiously, but getting nowhere. But as I essayed a few sclerotic revolutions myself, I understood that, on the contrary, it could be the perfect tonic.What do Schopenhauer\\\'s insights boil down to, after all, but the tried and tested message of the needlework sampler: it\\\'s not about the destination, it\\\'s the journey.All the data suggests that we\\\'re living longer and beginning to adapt accordingly. What used to be pensionable age is now considered late middle-life; if you\\\'re not there yet, by the time you are, it will probably have been recalibrated again, to the bloom of youth - think of all that time you\\\'ll have to work on your Pokemon Go handicap.So to anyone inclined to take a dim view of Clemenceau and the flicker of desire awakened in the octogenarian, all I can say is that he was clearly ahead of his time: 80 is the new 70.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37101625','2016-08-22 23:38:05','2016-08-20 08:08:20',1),(413,'Can the DJ of Dakar stop people emigrating?','Three-quarters of young people in Senegal want to emigrate - even though the journey to Europe could cost them their lives.','Fed up with the lack of opportunities at home, the majority of young people in Senegal dream of emigrating, even though the route to Europe is fraught with danger. Will new courses to teach them skills - such as DJ-ing - be enough to stop them leaving, asks Nicola Kelly.  \"We Senegalese, we are the black Chinese,\" Amadou tells me, flicking his waist-length dreadlocks over his shoulder and tugging his baseball cap firmly down. \"You give us one dollar, we make two!\"Behind us, the dull thud of the bass reverberates and the slap of hands marks the beginning of another day at the Senegal, one of the starting points for many migrants on the now well-trodden and ever more life-threatening journey through Libya to Europe, has been hit hard by the outward flow of its bright young things. A recent poll by the Oxford Migration Observatory found that three quarters of Senegalese aged 19 to 25 said they wanted to emigrate in the next five years.  Aware of the situation, local municipalities have stepped up funding for initiatives like this, a DJ school for aspiring musicians. Here they teach technical skills, help young people with their CVs and train them in interview technique.DJ GG Base is a well-known figure around these parts. He gestures to me to come forward as he takes to the decks, nudging his novice assistant aside to show him how it\\\'s done. The students huddle around. Smartphones are pulled out of pockets, videos recorded.  One of the group, Ismaila, elbows me and jabs his thumb in the direction of his master, head shaking in disbelief. I take this to mean the demo is exemplary.After posing for photos with the untouchably cool maestro DJ, I am initiated into the group with an official title: \"You have iPhones, Apple Macs, fancy DJ decks. One of you has a shiny car outside. Life here can\\\'t  be so bad!\" I protest.\"Yes,\" they admit, \"but most of our brothers, cousins and friends have left us behind to travel to Europe. We want to play in the big clubs. We want a future and that is just not possible in Senegal.\"And it\\\'s this that the centres have been set up to do - to give young people like Amadou and Ismaila a chance to reach their potential. Many of their peers are bored, disaffected, even - and that is leading some into trouble. They nod in unison when I ask them if programmes such as this help to keep them off the streets.\"We have a growing problem of jihad here in the suburbs.  If we don\\\'t occupy the youth, the youth will occupy themselves,\" Amadou says, voice gravelly, assured; tone frank.Later that evening, I take a stroll along the beach with Amadou. As night falls, this tiny strip on the waterfront is converted into a beach gym. Lithe young men shuttle back and forth between pebbles marking their distance.  Some repeat push-ups until they can stand it no longer - drops of sweat glistening on their foreheads as they sprint backwards up mounds of sand, then pose proudly at the top. They beckon me over and I tell them their use of the sand is very resourceful. They are lifeguards, waiters and security guards. \"I want to go to Europe to work in construction,\" Oumar says wistfully, eyes fixed on the horizon, face determined. \"When I have money, I will return home to Senegal and build a house for my family.\"The sole woman in the group - their \"sista\" - pipes up to ask where I am from. When I say I\\\'m from London, their expressions switch from mild curiosity to sheer delight. They talk quickly in Wolof for a moment, then switch back to French and tell me stories of their friends who have made the journey to Europe.\"I want to go too, but when I have a family I will move back to Senegal to live among our traditions, to teach my children our language,\" Sorna says decisively, her eyes flashing, enlivened by the idea. The men murmur in agreement.I ask what it would take to keep them here in Dakar. \"We need more than words,\" Amadou says. \"We need a framework, a way to find good jobs and learn new skills.  Only then will people like us decide not to get in those boats and cross that sea.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37129312','2016-08-22 23:38:05','2016-08-21 08:06:50',1),(414,'Germany considers return of conscription for civil defence','Germany may reintroduce national service for civilians to help the army deal with a future disaster, under a government plan.','Germany may reintroduce a form of national service for civilians to help the army deal with a future disaster.The role of civilians is part of a new civil defence strategy to be discussed by the government on Wednesday.Since the strategy was leaked to the media there has been intense debate about stockpiling food and water.In a crisis civilians might be obliged to help direct traffic or provide fuel and accommodation for the military, German news agency DPA reported.Germans appeared generally unfazed by what some MPs have called government \"scaremongering\" but the word \"Wehrpflicht\" (conscription) was trending on social media on Tuesday.The topic of civil defence also boosted the popularity of hamsters on social media, as Germans, with more than a hint of irony, adopted the hashtag \"Hamsterkaeufe\", which means panic-buying or hoarding like a hamster.Germany\\\'s Die Tageszeitung daily sported a A satirical The article was bylined, in English: \"Jean Gnatzig, Head of Silly Content\".The government said a national disaster was \"unlikely\" but preparations were needed in case of a future terror attack or \"hybrid\" conflict involving cyber warfare, which could damage key infrastructure.Russia\\\'s military intervention in Ukraine in 2014 - the clandestine seizure of Crimea and support for separatist rebels - has been widely described as \"hybrid warfare\". Germany scrapped compulsory national service in 2011, but provision for it remains in the constitution, so it could easily be reinstated, DPA says.During the Cold War, national service meant that West Germany could mobilise 495,000 soldiers and boost the numbers to about 1.2m if necessary by calling up reservists.School leavers had the option of doing 18 months\\\' civilian service - for example in a hospital - instead of nine months in the military.But at the height of the Cold War - in the 1960s and 1980s - conscripts had to spend 18 months in the military. Women were exempt from conscription.The new civil defence plan includes advice for citizens to store enough food to last 10 days, because emergency services might be fully stretched dealing with a major disaster. On drinking water, the advice is to stockpile five days\\\' supply - two litres (3.5 pints) per person daily.A public health manager with the German Red Cross, Wolfgang Kast, \"We\\\'ve got accustomed - not least because of the internet - to having everything available at all times,\" he said.He listed as key emergency provisions: water, noodles and tomato sauce, along with any required medicines, a torch, spare batteries and candles.On its website the German Federal Office of Civil Protection and Disaster Assistance (BBK) gives citizens ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37164960','2016-08-24 00:18:58','2016-08-23 19:55:04',1),(415,'Rio Paralympics 2016: Russian doping ban \'cynical\', says PM','Russia\'s PM Dmitry Medvedev says the decision to uphold a blanket doping ban on Russia\'s Paralympians is \"cynical\".','Russia has reacted with fury after a court upheld a ban on its athletes competing in next month\\\'s Paralympics.Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev called the ban, levelled over allegations of doping, a \"cynical decision\".On Tuesday the Court of Arbitration for Sport (Cas) upheld the International Paralympic Committee\\\'s (IPC) decision to ban all Russian competitors.The IPC made the decision after \"Banning our Paralympic athletes from Rio 2016 is a cynical decision motivated by a desire to remove strong rivals,\" Mr Medvedev said.Andrei Strokin, the Secretary General of the Russian Paralympic Committee, said that the mood of the athletes was low, \"because often for a disabled person it is the only chance of self-realisation and achieving something in life\".Roman Petushkov, a six-time Russian Paralympic champion, called the decision \"inhumane\" and a \"humiliation\".Long-jumper Vadim Alyoshkin said athletes were \"pawns in a big game we have nothing to do with\". But Karen Pickering, a four-time British Olympic athlete and four-time world champion, praised the decision.\"There is a real appetite right now amongst athletes that we don\\\'t want any former drug cheats in the Olympic Games,\" she said.Craig Spence from the IPC said the body had \"great sympathy\" with the Russian athletes but said the decision was prompted by evidence of a state-sponsored doping system.The Russian Paralympic Committee did not file any evidence contradicting the facts put forward by the IPC.The IPC\\\'s decision is in contrast to that of the International Olympic Committee (IOC), which The IOC was Instead, each individual sporting federation was given the power to decide if Russian competitors were allowed to compete.

The Cas statement added that it had not looked at the \"natural justice rights or personality rights\" of individual Russian athletes in making its decision.Russia\\\'s Paralympic team\\\'s lawyer, Alexei Karpenko, said they would try to file an appeal with the Swiss Federal Supreme Court, but it would take between one and two years for the court to consider the case. \"So I\\\'m afraid Russian Paralympians will not be going to the Games in any case,\" Mr Karpenko added.IPC president Sir Philip Craven, who has described Russia\\\'s anti-doping system as \"broken, corrupted and entirely compromised\", and claimed it put \"medals over morals\", said he was \"greatly encouraged\" by the Cas decision.He said it was \"not a day for celebration\", adding: \"We have enormous sympathy for the Russian athletes who will now miss out.\"\"It is a sad day for the Paralympic movement,\" said Craven. \"But we hope also a new beginning.

Turkish forces have been exchanging shellfire with IS positions in the Jarablus area since Monday.However, Turkey is also wary of moves that might bolster Syrian Kurdish forces, known as the YPG, which it views as an extension of the Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK), a Turkish-Kurdish rebel group fighting for autonomy since the 1980s.On Monday, Turkey shelled YPG positions near Manbij, a town they took from IS this month.  The 1,500 fighters poised to enter Syria from Gaziantep are believed to be Turkish-backed Syrian rebels.

The pro-Kurdish Peoples\\\' Democratic Party (HDP) said the wedding was for one of its members, and IS have targeted Turkish Kurds in the past.Many of the victims were children - the two youngest were four years old.

Tax revenue was projected to be between \\xc2\\xa31.7bn and \\xc2\\xa33.7bn lower. Ms Sturgeon, who also announced a new Scottish government minister on Brexit to lobby UK government, said \"This paper shows, in the starkest possible terms, the potentially huge cost to Scotland of being taken out of the European Union and the single market.\"This analysis - based on a wide range of sources - demonstrates that leaving the EU, under any potential alternative arrangement, will have a profound and long-lasting impact on the public finances and the wider economic and societal wellbeing of both Scotland and the UK as a whole.\"That stark picture outlined today means that, whatever the model of relationship with the EU which is chosen by the UK government in their negotiations before and after Article 50 is triggered, it will not be as economically beneficial as full EU membership.\"These figures are an arithmetical forecast, with caveats. They will be contested by those who argue that the UK/Scotland can thrive outside the EU. But they are also - indeed, primarily - a political tool.Practical implicationsFirstly, and most immediately, Nicola Sturgeon is seeking to some extent to pre-empt the publication on Wednesday of Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (GERS) figures. Given that oil has continued to decline and that the economy generally is less than buoyant, the latest GERS verdict is unlikely to be rosy.Secondly, and much more saliently, Ms Sturgeon is aiming an attack at the UK government and those who are currently pondering the practical implications of the Brexit vote.She is saying that unless Brexit is accompanied by a soft landing, unless there is substantial mitigation, unless the terms can be made relatively favourable, the potential cost is huge. So today\\\'s paper is designed to contribute, sharply, to the Brexit preparation process.However, there is a wider point. It is \"simply unacceptable\", Ms Sturgeon says, that \"Scotland faces the prospect of being dragged out of the EU against its will\".Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson accused Ms Sturgeon of using Brexit to deflect from the \"underlying fragility\" of Scotland\\\'s economy.She said: \"The first minister is in danger of losing the plot completely.\"Her own government\\\'s figures will show tomorrow that Scotland benefits from a multi-billion Union dividend.\"And yet, in order to revive her independence obsession, she is trying to pretend these facts don\\\'t exist.\"Ms Davidson added: \"Scotland benefits from being a member of the UK, and the UK benefits from our being there.\"It is time Nicola Sturgeon ended this charade, took her threat of a second independent referendum off the table, and got back to the day job of sorting out the mess her government has made of our public services.\"Scottish Labour Leader Kezia Dugdale said: \"Two months to the day since the EU referendum the SNP has finally highlighted the economic risks to Scotland of the UK leaving the EU.

This is the site of the El Houda Association Mosque, raided and closed down less than a fortnight after the jihadist attacks on Paris last November, which triggered a state of emergency across France. The reason, according to the authorities, was its alleged links to militant Islamist groups. For Mohammed, a local resident who worshipped there, the mosque was unremarkable. \"I\\\'m a practising Muslim and I always come here and I\\\'ve never seen anything strange. Closing spaces for the Muslim faith is not the right way,\" he says. El Houda was one of around 20 mosques closed down in the name of national security. That move has forced many of France\\\'s Muslims -  a diverse community estimated to be close to five million - into a period of deep introspection.   Many French Muslims resent the idea that violent acts of terrorism have been carried out in their name by jihadist groups such as so-called Islamic State. But they also object to the sense that they are having to justify themselves, in a country that prides itself on a strong secular tradition and the principles of Liberty, Equality and Fraternity. The French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), which acts as a bridge with the French government, is planning to create a foundation to oversee the vetting of imams and the funding of the mosques in which they preach. \"The idea would be to examine the theological path that imams have taken,\" says its president, Anouar Kbibech, \"to encourage them to study and sign a charter which promotes an open Islam, a tolerant Islam and an Islam that respects the values of the French Republic\".However, Marwan Muhammed, director of the Collective against Islamophobia, insists that does not equate to a jihadist threat. \"The authorities need to stop chasing people for being Muslim, for having a beard or for being religiously involved. This is not a sign of risk. This is a sign of religiosity.\" The senators found that 20 mosques received foreign funding, mainly from Turkey, Algeria, Morocco and, to a lesser extent, Saudi Arabia. The concern is not that overseas patrons are directly promoting violence, but that these mosques or prayer rooms create a highly politicised atmosphere, in which violence may be considered a tool for disseminating Islam.For that reason a new foundation to accredit imams and monitor finance is being considered. But some accuse the CFCM of pandering to the government\\\'s demands.\"We have very strong legislation on financial transactions and money laundering. So the existing legislation allows for the authorities to look into any suspicious transaction,\" argues Marwan Muhammed.A Frenchman of Moroccan descent, he worries about what he sees as a rising tide of Islamophobia in France, exacerbated by the prospect of presidential elections next year. He, like others, is worried the French government may in effect hijack any attempts by the Muslim community to become more open about their internal affairs. But the head of the CFCM, Anouar Kbibech, strikes a more conciliatory tone, mindful of the climate created by the most recent jihadist attacks in Nice and Rouen.Those attacks triggered a wave of new restrictions, including a ban on the wearing of burkinis on some of France\\\'s beaches - a move that some argue smacks of Islamophobia.\"We invite our fellow French citizens to avoid making links (with terrorism) and equally we invite our fellow Muslim citizens to pay attention to their activities and not exacerbate the issue and make things more complicated,\" says Mr Kbibech.In addition to advancing the case for better training of imams (many of whom are volunteers from within the community) the CFCM is considering new forms of domestic funding for France\\\'s mosques.  The senators\\\' report suggested that 20 mosques which received \\xe2\\x82\\xac6m (\\xc2\\xa35.2m; $6.8m) in foreign funding could benefit from a financial system involving a new foundation.Among the novel ideas being considered by the CFCM is a more formalised system of funding via the halal meat industry. But when the BBC tried out the idea on half a dozen halal butchers in Paris, it was met with puzzled faces.The vast majority of France\\\'s mosques are funded by voluntary contributions from within the community, occasionally even from halal butchers.French senator Nathalie Goulet believes clamping down on mosques to deter extremists misses the point altogether. \"Radicalisation happens outside mosques and more often in prison. The thing all young radicalised people have in common is their weak understanding of the religion,\" she argues. Muslims make up less than 10% of France\\\'s population and yet they make up some 60% of the prison population.The French authorities have sought to introduce de-radicalisation programmes. And yet, many Muslims believe France still needs to address problems of marginalisation, as well as the way Islam is portrayed in French media. Otherwise they fear France may continue to offer fertile ground for Islamist extremists.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-37155043','2016-08-24 00:18:58','2016-08-23 07:08:02',1),(433,'Haunted man','Ismail Isli narrowly survived an IS attack on the Turkish capital Ankara last October and now has to come to terms with the loss of people he knew at Gaziantep.','When bombers from the jihadist group Islamic State (IS) killed 100 people at a peace rally in Ankara in October 2015, Ismail Isli\\\'s niece and six of his close friends were among the victims.He survived the attack but he is counting the cost again after the bombing of a wedding party in the southern city of Gaziantep in which 54 people died, including 29 children.Ismail knew the latest victims too.I had met him in a cafe in the Mediterranean coastal town of Alanya hours before the Gaziantep attack. The Ankara bombing had left him in a coma for two weeks.

And he was going to tell me about his 20-year old niece when we returned to the cafe the next morning.The bombing of the wedding party changed all that. I left for Gaziantep at 03:00 on Sunday morning as Turkish media showed terrible images of the attack.When I texted Ismail to apologise that we could not meet, he replied immediately.\"I couldn\\\'t sleep all night,\" he told me. \"I know the family whose children are getting married.

What obstacles does he face?','Former French head of state Nicolas Sarkozy has announced that he is a candidate to run again in next year\\\'s presidential election.    In order to stand, he must first win his centre-right Republicans party\\\'s primary in November.    Mr Sarkozy said he \"felt he had the strength to lead the combat at such a tormented moment in our history.\"  No-one doubts his energy, but a number of obstacles must be overcome if he is to fight his way back to the Elysee.Nicolas Sarkozy served as French president from 2007 to 2012, and the country he left behind as he walked from the Elysee was not a happy one.    The campaign promises of a land where people could \"work more to earn more\" had vanished. Unemployment was back near 10%; the deficit ballooning; and the much-vaunted \"rupture\" with the country\\\'s uncompetitive past as much a dream as five years previously.Mr Sarkozy could argue - with some justice - that all his plans to rewire the economy had gone down the drain by the 2008 world crisis. But still the man with all the answers turned out to be mainly mouth.Nicolas Sarkozy may want to be the centre-right candidate next April, but sadly for him others have the same idea. There are in fact 10 other runners in the November primary, most of whom have no chance whatsoever and are merely putting down markers for the future. A couple are serious rivals.   There is Mr Sarkozy\\\'s former Prime Minister Francois Fillon - the man who learned to swallow hard and keep looking impassive through whatever his master\\\'s latest putdown.    And then there is Alain Juppe - another former prime minister. Right now Mr Juppe is in fact the favourite to win in the November primary - so Mr Sarkozy has a tough and potentially bitter fight ahead.Mr Sarkozy\\\'s enemies have always given themselves heart from the thought that if all else fails to bring him down,  justice will.  The list of \"affaires\" in which the former president is embroiled is long and very complicated. Two stand out.   In the first, Mr Sarkozy is accused of knowingly exceeding campaign funding limits in the 2012 election. In the second, he is said to have put pressure on a judge to reveal details on another case in which he was implicated.In both of these affairs, Mr Sarkozy is \"mis en examen\" - in other words he is formally the target of a judicial investigation that might well end in a trial.  Were that to happen in the weeks to come, his chances would be scuppered. Luckily for Mr Sarkozy, the wheels of French justice grind exceeding slow.  Still - the law is a weak spot.   Bling is such an annoying, meaningless expression - but Mr Sarkozy undoubtedly suffered from his supposed affinity for a certain kind of lifestyle.    He came to be viscerally loathed by a large part of the population - not just as a political figure, but for the kind of man he was.   In truth, his lifestyle was not that different from other French leaders\\\'. Carla Bruni was no liability: in fact she is quite admired.Far more problematic was Nicolas Sarkozy\\\'s odd personality: impulsive, cocky, braggadocio masking some inner insecurity.   Many people didn\\\'t like it, and they still don\\\'t.If Nicolas Sarkozy ends up against Francois Hollande in 2017 (and it is perfectly possible), it will be an exact re-run of 2012.

One of the key problems they hope to solve is how to protect UK access to Europe\\\'s markets, while controlling immigration from the EU.Many in Britain wonder if non-EU member Switzerland could show the way. Switzerland has access to Europe\\\'s single market, its economy is booming, unemployment is low. The country, at first sight, thrives outside the EU.But first appearances can be deceptive. In one very crucial area, immigration, the Swiss find themselves in a very tricky position.It is all to do with a landmark referendum held in February 2014, when the Swiss voted - very narrowly - in favour of quotas on immigration from the EU.That sounds a perfectly reasonable thing to do: Switzerland is not in the EU and should, it might be assumed, be able to control its borders, and the numbers of people arriving to work.But it is not that simple. Over more than a decade the Swiss, whose economy depends on trade with Europe, have negotiated a series of bilateral, but interdependent, agreements with Brussels. Access to the EU\\\'s single market hinges on Switzerland\\\'s participation in free movement of people.And so, two-and-a-half years after the vote for quotas, nothing has changed. Free movement is still in place in Switzerland. Despite ever more desperate efforts by Swiss diplomats to negotiate a deal with the EU that would honour voters\\\' wishes, the silence from Brussels has been deafening.\"The EU has one red line, and that is quotas,\" explained Cenni Najy of the Swiss political think-tank Foraus.\"They will never accept quotas, because that would mean really the end of free movement.\"And Mr Najy believes Britain\\\'s vote to leave the EU will make Switzerland\\\'s situation even more difficult.\"I think Switzerland will have to wait many months, maybe even many years,\" he said. \"Now the number one preoccupation of the European Commission is to find a settlement for the UK, and not to allow Switzerland to free ride or to have very specific tailor-made agreements.\"But Switzerland cannot afford the delay. The government is in a race against time to prepare legislation to limit EU immigration, before a March 2017 deadline demanded under the Swiss constitution.The conundrum is: how to introduce the quotas that voters say they want, while preserving that crucial access to Europe\\\'s single market.Last month, Switzerland\\\'s President Johann Schneider-Ammann met the European Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, on the sidelines of the Asia-Europe Summit in Mongolia.Swiss diplomats were privately relieved the meeting involved a quick coffee and not just a handshake in a corridor, but it did not yield the deal the Swiss had hoped for.Later Mr Schneider-Ammann, in an interview with Swiss television, bluntly highlighted the problem.\"We\\\'ve got to find a way to keep free movement of people, and to respect the will of the voters to reduce immigration... we\\\'re trying to square a circle.\"Swiss business leaders, increasingly uncertain about how long they will be able to recruit from Europe, or how long their access to the single market will last, are worried.\"It doesn\\\'t help investors in Switzerland as long as this big question is not settled with the European Union,\" pointed out Jan Atteslander of the Swiss Business Federation.The federation has been working on compromise proposals: not exactly quotas, but a mechanism under which employers would be required to give preference to workers already living in Switzerland, if, in certain professions, unemployment was high.\"It\\\'s a safeguard clause,\" Mr Atteslander explained. \"That in some areas, where you see too high immigration, you can slow it down temporarily, and then after a quarter or half a year you can look again.\"It is believed the UK government may also be looking at such options.The problem, many analysts believe, is that a deal designed to please everyone, both Brussels and Swiss voters, may actually please no one. It is unlikely that Mr Atteslander\\\'s modest temporary suggestion - which, given Switzerland\\\'s strong economy and need for skilled workers, is unlikely even to be triggered in the foreseeable future - will please the powerful right-wing Swiss People\\\'s Party (SVP). It campaigned hard for proper quotas on immigration, and its leaders insist that the will of Swiss voters must be honoured in full.Meanwhile from Brussels\\\' point of view, a safeguard clause which appears to discriminate against EU citizens in favour of the Swiss could still be viewed as a violation of free movement.And so another solution is emerging, which may sound rather familiar to Brexit Britain.Among young Swiss, a majority of whom voted against immigration quotas, there is a movement to hold the vote all over again. The necessary 100,000 signatures have been gathered, and campaigner Sean Serafin believes a new vote will be more informed than the last one.\"When voting on quotas the Swiss had a system they knew well, which was freedom of movement, and a theoretical system, quotas, which was not very clear,\" he explained. \"So I think they decided to vote for some sort of control over immigration, without knowing what it meant.\"Mr Serafin is confident that, now that voters know how hard it is to \"square the circle\" with Brussels, they may change their minds, and back free movement of people.But a new referendum cannot be held before that March deadline, and the Swiss now hope a visit to Zurich, planned for September by Jean-Claude Juncker, might bring a deal. Political analyst Cenni Najy is sceptical. \"Within the internal market there are four freedoms, and you cannot disassociate them,\" he says. \"If you want access to the internal market, you have to accept free movement of persons. They [the EU] have said it to Switzerland and I think they are going to say it also to the UK.\"Some of Britain\\\'s most Eurosceptic politicians have suggested leaving the single market would be a survivable move. But UK business leaders, like the Swiss, are becoming anxious.So while Britain agonises over its EU exit strategy, in Switzerland the waiting game continues. Perhaps that deafening EU silence over Swiss attempts to change free movement is directed not just at the little alpine country, but at the big island nation across the Channel too.

A three-person IOC panel then had the final say.In the end, more than 270 Russian athletes were cleared to compete at the Olympics, with Russia winning 56 medals in total and finishing in fourth place in the medal table.Russia had been set to take 267 competitors across 18 sports to the Paralympics.

The new generation of state-educated athletes is challenging private school dominance, says the charity. Sutton Trust chairman Sir Peter Lampl described the findings as \"fantastic\". The Sutton Trust, which campaigns to increase social mobility through education, analysed the school background both of medal winners and Team GB members overall. Fewer than a third of the 130 Team GB medallists at the Rio Olympics attended fee-paying schools. While the 13 most successful Olympians - those who won multiple medals at Rio - were more likely to come from state schools, says the charity. But this still means that compared with the general population, Team GB members are still four times more likely to have been privately educated, says the charity. For the team as a whole, whether medal winners or not, the numbers privately educated rose from 20% in 2012 to 28% this year. And when it comes to rowing and hockey the proportion of privately educated players is 52% and 50% respectively, says the charity. It points out that an old Etonian has won a medal for team GB every year since 1992. These include Matthew Pinsent in rowing in 1992, 1996, 2000 and 2004  and William Fox-Pitt in equestrian eventing in 2008 and 2012, as well as Constantine Louloudis with a rowing bronze in London and gold in Rio. The charity says a growing trend for partnerships between state and private schools has helped boost the prospects of athletes like swimming gold medallist Adam Peaty who attended state school but used training facilities at Repton public school.

In early interviews, Mr Assange said it was intended to be a \"giant library of the world\\\'s most persecuted documents\".It has now published more than 10 million documents including:The news organisation combed through the site and found many instances where sensitive personal information was easily viewable in documents and files. In the worst cases the information revealed could put lives at risk or lead to people being jailed or harassed, it said.  It is not the only risk involved with information on the site. Security researcher Vesselin Bontchev However, it has taken some action to make it harder to fall victim to malware in the AKP files - though the dangerous links have not been completely removed.Not always. Sometimes the original whistle-blower publishes the files themselves in other places. In some cases more information is released via that route than is available via Wikileaks. However, in most cases the majority of files are accessible via Wikileaks, and its decision to publish information can mean they get more publicity.Human rights groups have asked Wikileaks many times to do more to censor information found in documents. They fear reprisals against aid workers, activists and civilians named in the leaked data.In addition, AP said it had evidence that fraudsters had used credit card numbers and other personal details revealed in some documents. Other leaks have lead to people losing their jobs, or have ended relationships.The US government has condemned Wikileaks several times, saying its work has harmed diplomatic relations and put the lives of staff in sensitive positions at risk. Direct evidence of harm has been hard to find, but in 2010 \"Yes,\" says Prof Christian Christensen, from the University of Stockholm who studies media and communication. \"In the long run they have done a lot of good.\"The early leaks it oversaw gave insights into corporate and official abuse on a scale never seen before, he said, adding that it also made it much easier for whistle-blowers and activists to get information into the public domain. He said the organisation was now operating in a very different world than it did a decade ago when it was set up. To begin with, he said, there was much more competition for Wikileaks.Publishing quickly and doing less to curate documents was one way for Wikileaks to remain relevant, he said.However, he added, there had been a shift in the information it released. Now, the information was less about clear cases of harm or the abuse of power, and more to do with subjects that were much less black and white. There was a danger, he said, that Wikileaks was now part of the story rather than just the route through which information is released.\"When that happens it really starts to muddy the waters,\" he said.In the early days of Wikileaks, it took more care - thanks to working with newspapers that did the job of removing sensitive information from documents about the Afghan and Iraq wars.Spokesman Julian Assange has often said that the sheer amount of documents Wikileaks handles makes it all but impossible to censor or edit them if they are to be released in a timely fashion.In some cases it has no way to contact whoever handed over documents, making it difficult to find out what information might prove damaging.The lack of oversight has led to criticism about the release of almost 300,000 emails from Turkey\\\'s AKP, with some saying they contained more trivia than treasure.  Wikileaks practices what it calls \"radical transparency\", said Prof Christensen, which leads it to believe that exposing corruption, malfeasance and abuse of power trumps the damage it might do to individuals. Many other whistle-blowing sites take greater care with documents they are passed to ensure that no more information than necessary is released.No. The \"wiki\" part of the name simply refers to its aim of letting people collaborate to edit documents and releases. The original idea was for Wikileaks to build up a large group of helpers that would censor and prepare information before publication. This changed in 2010 when the organisation became more centralised.The change in structure led to a split that saw some of its original co-founders leave and others ended their association with it. Ironically, for an organisation that preaches \"radical transparency\" it has never revealed how many people work for it, or who oversees the release of information.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37165230','2016-08-24 00:18:58','2016-08-23 23:15:31',1),(484,'Android 7.0 Nougat released by Google','Google rolls out a new version of Android that allows mobile devices to run two apps simultaneously on the same screen.','','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-37154926','2016-08-24 00:18:58','2016-08-23 01:59:36',1),(485,'India runner OP Jaisha \'not given water\' at Rio','An Olympic woman marathon runner from India says she was not provided water and energy drinks by Indian officials at designated stations.','An Olympic woman marathon runner from India has alleged she was not provided water and energy drinks by Indian officials at designated stations.OP Jaisha said she \"could have died\" after the women\\\'s marathon in Rio.

This could endanger livelihoods and food security in fragile economies that are ill-prepared to deal with the expansion of invasive organisms.Dr Early commented: \"Rampant globalisation will lead to invasions in countries with the least capability to deal with them. \"We need more international cooperation, and the US, Australia and nations in Europe to share expertise.\"Prof Dukes added: \"Low-income countries stand to lose a lot by having their natural resources sapped by invasive species.\"We hope this analysis can be a conversation starter for governments around the world to strengthen their protection.\"Invasive species often travel as stowaways or contaminants in goods imported by planes and ships. They also arrive as exotic pets or plants that subsequently escape or are released deliberately into the wild.This can pose challenges native species that have evolved over thousands of years to be well adapted to their ecosystems. Consequently, new arrivals can quickly change the nature of a whole region and often outcompete native organisms for resources and habitat.Burmese pythons originally arrived in the US as exotic pets, but they escaped and quickly established themselves in the Florida Everglades, where they have contributed to a catastrophic decline in native mammals.In Europe, forests and woods have been transformed by introduced diseases and pests such as Dutch elm disease and Ash dieback.\"You can think of invasive species as biological pollution - a self-replicating change,\" said Prof Dukes.\"It doesn\\\'t take much effort or intention to bring in an invasive species that then wreaks havoc on a landscape.\"Biological invasions in the developing world so far have included influxes of Diamondback moths, which can devastate broccoli, cabbage and other crops; Panama disease, which wiped out banana plantations in central and south America; and prickly pear, which devastated grassland in Africa, leading to cattle being malnourished.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37165712','2016-08-24 00:18:58','2016-08-23 19:33:02',1),(489,'New badger culling trials given go ahead across England','Badger culls are to be carried out in five new areas of England in a bid to control bovine TB, the BBC learns.','Badger culls are to be carried out in five new areas of England in a bid to control bovine TB, the BBC has learnt.Shooting of badgers will begin in early September in South Devon, North Devon, North Cornwall, West Dorset, and South Herefordshire, the BBC understands.Culling is part of the government\\\'s 25-year-strategy to eradicate the disease, but opponents say there is no evidence culling is effective.Dorset, Gloucestershire and Somerset are already practising culling.The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) would not confirm the selections had been made but said it was \"currently considering applications for further badger control licences as part of the usual licensing process\".However, the BBC understands that culling companies have already been selected, and marksmen trained for the new locations.Tony Francis, a farmer who had TB in his herd near Okehampton in Devon, said he had signed up to one of the new cull zones to try to prevent the disease from returning.\"It\\\'s an issue which has been going on for decades,\" he said.\"No-one has really got on top of it.

There was a resurgence in a hashtag which translates as \"Rio Olympics Using Wrong Chinese National Flag\"; which has been used more than eight million times on the Sina Weibo micro-blogging platform. This time most of those using it were asking variations of the same question: \\\'How could the Rio Olympics make the same mistake again?\\\'.On the first day of the games, the incorrect flag was used during the medal ceremony of the women\\\'s 10m air rifle with China\\\'s Du Li and Yi Siling as silver and bronze medal winner respectively.The errors in the flag were immediately pointed out and produced an apology from Mario Andrada, Communications Director for Rio 2016. New correct flags were swiftly ordered and were used for almost all of the remaining medal ceremonies in which China was involved. So there was considerable disbelief when the wrong design resurfaced right at the end of the Olympics.The Rio Olympic committee is reportedly investigating how this happened and is expected to tender an official apology to China.One Weibo user complained,: \"Making such a mistake again is really absurd!  Chinese people can\\\'t accept the apology from Rio Olympic Committee.\"The proper Chinese flag features one big star surrounded with four smaller stars against a red background.The larger yellow star represents the Communist Party of China, and the four smaller stars symbolise the solidarity of Chinese people of all social classes and ethnic groups under the leadership of the CPC. In the correct version the four smaller stars all point towards the big star.But in the inaccurate one that appeared at Rio 2016 the four smaller stars were parallel to each other.When the wrong flags first appeared some media reports mistakenly claimed that they had been manufactured in China. But this was strongly denied by a spokesman for the firm that was blamed, Zhejiang Wuyi Jinyu Textile Co Ltd. A company spokesman said: \"We are not responsible for the wrong Chinese national flags that are used at the Olympics ceremonies. The national flags we\\\'ve manufactured are for the audiences.. Being Chinese, how can we get the Chinese national flags wrong?! \"Later the Rio Olympic committee admitted that the offending Chinese flags were made in Brazil and promised to investigate.However, this has failed to pacify some Weibo users. \"Rio Olympics is rubbish,\" wrote one user called Kepler. \"Not only were the referees not fair, but also getting the Chinese national flags wrong again. Brazil has no qualification to hold and compete in the Olympics.\"Another commenting using the name Ghz joked, that there was at least one positive: \"This Olympic ends. My big gain is that I finally know what the Chinese national flag looks like.

Ronald dela Rosa was speaking at a senate hearing into the sharp rise in deaths since Rodrigo Duterte became president.He said police operations had killed about 750 people, but the other deaths were still being investigated.Mr Duterte won the presidency with his hard-line policy to eradicate drugs.He has previously urged citizens to shoot and kill drug dealers who resisted arrest, and reiterated that the killings of drug suspects were lawful if the police acted in self-defence. He also threatened to \"separate\" from the UN after it called his war on drugs a crime under international law. The US has said it is \"deeply concerned\" by the increase in drug-related killings.The senate joint inquiry is being conducted by Senator Leila de Lima, who has called on authorities to explain the \"unprecedented\" rise in deaths. It is also hearing from the relatives of some of those killed. The family members of some of those killed are getting the chance to tell their stories to the inquiry.Wearing dark glasses and draped in a shawl, Harra Besorio said policemen raided her home in Pasay City without a warrant and stripped her infant daughter to check for drugs. Her partner, who she admitted was a small-time dealer, and his father were beaten up in front of them, she told the inquiry on Monday. They were later taken to a police station and allegedly killed there.The two police officers accused claimed an attempt had been made to grab one of their guns, but this was refuted by the Philippines Commission on Human Rights. It said they had been badly injured and were shot three times. The two officers have been charged with murder.Mr dela Rosa told the inquiry on Tuesday that a total of 1,916 deaths had been recorded during the crackdown, 756 of which were during police operations.He said the number had gone up even since he gave evidence on Monday, where he gave a figure of 1,800 deaths.\"Not all deaths under investigations are drug-related,\" he told news agency Reuters, saying about 40 killings were due to robbery or personal disputes.However, Mr dela Rosa said there was no declared policy to kill drug users and pushers, saying police were \"not butchers\".The police director-general also added that about 300 police officers were suspected to be involved in the drugs trade, warning that they would be charged and removed from their positions if found guilty. Nearly 700,000 drug users and peddlers have turned themselves in since the launch of the campaign, Mr dela Rosa said.He also said that there was a decrease in overall crime, though the number of homicides and murders had increased. On Monday, Mr dela Rosa told the inquiry: \"I admit many are dying but our campaign, now, we have the momentum.\" Senator Frank Drilon told Reuters that the number of deaths was \"alarming\" and had \"a chilling effect\".In his previous role as mayor of Davao, Mr Duterte built a reputation for blunt speaking and supporting the extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals. Crime rates in Davao decreased while he was in office, though human rights groups estimate than more than 1,000 people were killed with no legal process.

But the side finishing last in the Premier League this season is guaranteed about £97m.With such a financial gulf beginning to emerge across the continent, Uefa is under pressure to deliver a significant uplift in revenues for Champions League TV rights when negotiations begin later this year.Sports companies in the US and China have proposed a breakaway league but Ceferin insists European football will remain united.\"One of the main issues awaiting the next Uefa president is relations to the big clubs,\" he said.\"My firm opinion is that some kind of closed super league with just a few clubs in, without the possibility for the others to enter, is out of the question. It will mean a kind of war between Uefa and the clubs. \"If they want more revenues we should work on it. It is possible. The Champions League is the best sports product in the world, for sure.

Before, with Michel Platini, we had a charismatic leader. Now, if I come there, we will have a team leader. \"I think Uefa has, in principle, a good administration. We have great experts in the FAs which were not included in the decision-making. So I think that should change.And after the controversial years of Blatter and Platini, he thinks football is ready for a new face despite his relative inexperience.\"Of course, we should work together with some people who are experienced but to try to say only the one who is there for 30 years could lead Uefa?

We are not to be laughed at.\\\'  Well sure, absolutely. You are exceptional sportspersons and, don\\\'t worry, we have imagined most of you with your kit off. But Olympians or not, we have laughed. And I will tell you for why.  You see, your Interested in you. In sport. In the Olympics. Many of us were inspired to get fit. Many of us were inspired to take up or rediscover a past love for a sport. And we were all excited about what you would do in Rio and over the past two weeks have been joyfully stuck in front of the TV with a daily remote control-based workout.  If I had put weights in my remote controls I would now have the biceps of Andy Murray and the triceps of Louis Smith.  You may think it\\\'s stressful competing - try working out when and where to watch a particular event on the television. The Radio Times edition needed a heavy weight to lift it. It has been a test of mental resilience and physical prowess to stay awake, set alarms, find the right channel, let alone deal with the nail-biting races. Frankly, I think you had it easy.  Suffice to say we were glued. And the laughs came because most of us were predominantly watching sports we have NO IDEA about! Seriously, NOT A CLUE.  No idea about any of the rules, regulations or regimes. All we knew was we really cared, we wanted to support you and we wanted you to win. But our sitting rooms and social media were awash with giggle-inducing questions and speculations.Simply, there are massive adult men on tiny children\\\'s bikes.  Why do they all have tiny little towels they slap themselves with? And do they get extra points if, when throwing them to the floor from the board, they hit another competitor? (I definitely think that should be a thing in 2020).  Plus in diving, men lose their trunks. I mean, hello - funny. I can\\\'t have been in the only household that played bare bottom bingo.  And of course we had pun-tastic commentator Leon Taylor who, if he ever said a diver had \"done a banana\", we wondered whether he was talking about the dive or the Speedo adjustment. Why has one person worn the wrong outfit in the team? And, in beach volleyball, what happens if sand gets \\\'up there\\\' - are you allowed a-sand-in-crack removal break?Why does the pitch seem to have the consistency of a leaking water bed? Why are they putting Hannibal Lecter masks on then throwing them away? What are the rules of a penalty shootout? Doesn\\\'t matter it\\\'s GOLD.For starters there is constant mounting and dismounting (always funny), then there\\\'s the pommel horse - what IS that? And has anyone whacked their down-belows whilst doing the scissors on it? And why on the floor do they have to do little jump-ettes and twizzles to the corner or side rather than just a normal step? It suddenly becomes ballet.How on EARTH do you get a horse to dance like that? It\\\'s a dancing horse for heavens sake! It\\\'s like a toy. By the way, I now have a team from Twitter who are starting a campaign for human dressage in 2020. Humans dressed as horses, doing the trotting and galloping manoeuvres, with a team member next to them making clip clop sounds with coconuts.  Well, where to begin really! Lots of people agreeing with me it was essential to make the \\\'I am enjoying some cheese and Omnium\\\' gag.  Comedy bronze there at best. And lots of laughs at the man on the motorbike starting the race, who always looked like he never meant to be there and was lost. Like if he had a basket on the back with a baguette and a pint of milk and had just taken a wrong turn back from the shops and got caught up in an Olympic cycling race. But suffice to say we were not laughing at you. Goodness me, no. We were laughing at ourselves. Despite our lack of knowledge (and we are learning, I promise) we were with you every step of the way. Truly. As I say, we really deeply cared. Our sofas became front row stadium seats and we acted as if we were there with you, though we had the advantage of anxiety-induced snack-eating (which I made a sport in itself).I leapt off my sofa when we got that I bounced till I did a bit of wee when And there were of course many tears.

Lutalo Muhammad losing We know how hard your disappointments hurt, but we couldn\\\'t be prouder of you.  The Olympics has been pure theatre. Nail-biting drama (and unexpected comedy). And why? Because you have literally and metaphorically run with the gifts you have been given and sacrificed yourselves.  You have pushed yourself to your limit to go for glory.

Contenders include a cyclist who had a team-mate in tears and a sprinter out to match Usain Bolt.','When the flame was extinguished at the Rio was our last chance to delight in the talents of sprinter Usain Bolt, swimmer Michael Phelps, cyclist Sir Bradley Wiggins and heptathlete Jessica Ennis-Hill on the biggest sporting stage of all. While British cyclists Laura Trott and Jason Kenny, and American decathlete Ashton Eaton, among others, are young enough to continue to carry the torch of Olympic greatness, new stars must come to the fore for Tokyo 2020. The list is not definitive - and no-one knows what the future will hold - but here we select 10 athletes who could be the headline acts in four years\\\' time. With a stunning attack on the final sprint to win gold, Dibben stirred the 8,000-strong crowd during the points race at the It was a performance that had team-mate Owain Doull tweeting of his tears. The world champion - and European omnium bronze medallist - was also part of the men\\\'s team pursuit that won world silver in London in March. But the 22-year-old Team Wiggins rider was not selected for Rio, with Mark Cavendish - who went on to win omnium silver - preferred. The 30-year-old Manxman is unlikely to compete in Japan and with Rio also being Wiggins\\\' Olympic farewell, Tokyo could be Dibben\\\'s time. Rio 2016 saw Britain\\\'s \\\'other\\\' divers come to prominence. Jack Laugher became the nation\\\'s most successful diver in Olympic history with gold and silver, while Dan Goodfellow ably supported Tom Daley as the pair won 10m platform synchronised bronze. Daley is still his sport\\\'s headline act, but the 22-year-old cannot twist and tuck forever and failed to reach the 10m platform final. Step forward Toulson, at 16 one of the youngest British athletes competing in Brazil. The teenager from Huddersfield was accustomed to winning medals in junior championships and was ranked third in the world, with partner Tonia Couch, in the women\\\'s synchronised 10m prior to the Games.Toulson - who will soon receive her GCSE results - and Couch did not finish in the top three in Brazil, extending Britain\\\'s run without a women\\\'s Olympic diving medal to 56 years, but Tokyo could be the city where the long wait ends.Many a British gymnast will return home with their reputations enhanced and names in British sporting history - such as double Olympic champion Max Whitlock, 16-year-old bronze medallist Amy Tinkler and Nile Wilson, the high bar Olympic bronze medallist.It was a record seven Olympic medals for Britain\\\'s gymnasts, but amid the celebrations, it is easy to forget those who did not win a medal.Downie, the first British woman to win an all-around medal at a major gymnastics championships, described Rio as a \"rollercoaster experience\". She fell on her neck during the qualifying stages and went on to finish 13th in the all-around, but the Nottingham athlete will only be 20 when the Olympic flame arrives in Japan and, along with Tinkler, could by then be matching the world\\\'s best somersault for somersault. There will be no Bolt at the next Olympics to inspire and entertain. While no-one can replace the greatest track and field athlete who has ever lived, De Grasse could be the man to dominate men\\\'s sprinting once the nine-time Olympic champion says his final goodbyes to the sport. The 21-year-old, who only took up athletics seriously four years ago, recorded personal bests in both the 100m (9.91 seconds) and 200m (19.80 seconds) in Rio.

His performances in Rio have strengthened many people\\\'s belief he could become the world\\\'s fastest swimmer.

The man who could be the heir to Uchimura\\\'s throne is 19-year-old Shiral. In 2013, aged 17, he mesmerised on the floor to become world champion on that apparatus and retained his title in 2015. He surprisingly failed to shine on the floor in Rio, with Britain\\\'s Whitlock claiming gold, but that should not rule him out of potentially vying for Olympic titles on home soil.

Greater democracy has not brought greater respect for the stateless Rohingya\\\'s human rights.But the formation of an Advisory Commission on Rakhine State represents a rare glimmer of hope.For the first time, the Burmese government is seeking international expertise to try and solve one of the country\\\'s most complex problems.It\\\'s a significant shift. For years, the official Burmese mantra has been that \"no foreigner can possibly understand Rakhine\\\'s problems\".Now Kofi Annan, the former UN secretary general, has been tasked with taking a fresh look at the issues as head of nine-member commission. His report could just add to the mountain of papers written about Rakhine and the Rohingya, or it just might be a game-changer.So what\\\'s Aung San Suu Kyi up to?Well, first a cynical take. Next week the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon is due in the Burmese capital Nay Pyi Taw and in September Ms Suu Kyi will head to the United States for the UN General Assembly and talks with President Obama.The Nobel laureate was no doubt bracing herself for awkward questions about why she wasn\\\'t doing more to help Myanmar\\\'s Muslim minority and in particular the 800,000 or so Rohingya. Those questions can now be easily deflected with reference to this new commission.But there\\\'s more at play than that. By setting up the commission, Ms Suu Kyi is signalling that she is open to new ideas, and doesn\\\'t have all the answers.Kofi Annan may be 78 but, as you\\\'d expect from a former UN secretary general, he\\\'s his own man. The final report, due to be delivered by the end of August 2017, is likely to contain suggestions that many Burmese consider unpalatable. Almost certainly it will insist that the Rohingya\\\'s basic human rights are respected, perhaps recommending that Myanmar offer them a better route to citizenship.In Myanmar\\\'s current political climate it\\\'s hard for Ms Suu Kyi to bring those ideas to the table. She\\\'d be attacked not just by hardline Buddhists but many within her own party. So Kofi Annan and his report could be the \"Trojan Horse\" that brings this sort of proposal into the national debate.There are of course plenty of caveats.Problems as deeply entrenched as those between the Buddhist and Muslim communities in Rakhine State will not be solved overnight. The animosity between them has built up over decades with many in the Buddhist majority seeing the Rohingya as illegal immigrants from across the border in Bangladesh.After the violence of 2012, more than 100,000 Rohingya were forced from their homes into camps. In the years that have followed there\\\'s been no real effort to help them return. Rakhine has become increasingly segregated, with some comparing it to South Africa\\\'s apartheid. Things have become quieter but there\\\'s been little reconciliation.Whatever the commission ends up concluding, any move to give the Rohingya greater rights will be hugely controversial not just in Rakhine State but across the country.Vocal parts of the Buddhist community are openly hostile towards international aid agencies and the UN. They\\\'re unlikely to welcome Kofi Annan\\\'s team, no doubt anticipating the sort of recommendations he might make. Implementing any \"solution\" will be even harder.  But the formation of this advisory commission is something new. However small, it\\\'s the first bit of positive news that the Rohingya have had for a long time.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37172014','2016-08-24 23:55:30','2016-08-24 17:30:21',1),(537,'How good is Tibet\'s Beijing-backed search engine?','A new Tibetan-language search engine has raised suspicions about the Chinese government\'s motives.','A Tibetan search engine, backed by the Chinese authorities, has been launched.Yongzim claims to be better at handling complex searches involving several words in the language than any alternative.But a spokesman for the government in exile, the Central Tibetan Administration, told the BBC it could also be used as a \"platform to promote propaganda to legitimise the illegal occupation of Tibet.\" Exile groups and non-governmental organisations (NGOs) around the world accuse Beijing of Both Google - which is blocked in China and therefore also in Tibet - and the Chinese search engine Baidu can also carry out searches in Tibetan. But According to Chinese state media, the service will promote the Tibetan language and provide a dedicated platform for Tibetan-language websites. \"[It will] meet the growing needs of the Tibetan-speaking population and facilitate the building of Tibetan digital archives and the expansion of databases in the Tibetan language,\" an official said. Kyinzom Dhongdue, of the Australia Tibet Council, told the BBC she welcomed the initiative as a \"positive step towards popularising the use of the Tibetan language\" but cautioned it could become a \"propaganda tool\" for Beijing. Aynne Kokas, an expert on Chinese media at the University of Virginia in the US, also described it as being a \"major technological advancement\" that could be useful for \"non-sensitive queries\". But she said it would also \"make it easier to redirect web traffic\" to sites that tallied with the Chinese government\\\'s views.The Free Tibet movement noted that the effort marked a change of policy.\"After decades of effectively suppressing the Tibetan language, China now puts emphasis on being seen to support it,\" spokesman Alistair Currie told the BBC. \"As with everything in Tibet, language is tainted with political connotations, and Beijing wants to control any development rather than permit it.\"A simple picture search for the term Dalai Lama - the spiritual and former political leader of Tibet who fled the country after China took control of the territory in 1950 - is revealing.Yongzim brings up only a single result, unlike Google, which produces dozens of photos. \"As we have already seen with Baidu, though the site is highly functional, the more centralisation there is of search, the easier it is to block specific terms,\" Ms Kokas told the BBC. Even so, many \"young, educated, online-savvy Tibetans inside Tibet have welcomed\" the new search engine in their own language, said Ms Dhongdue. \"[Yet] this can also be seen as the Chinese government trying to win the hearts of the educated elites in Tibet,\" she said.\"In recent years, a growing number of the educated youth in Tibet has expressed their criticism of China\\\'s policies in Tibet through blogs, art and music.\" With the internet becoming ever more widely accessible in Tibet, the number of websites in the region\\\'s language has steadily been on the rise, including blogs and social media. Accordingly, Chinese authorities have paid close attention to the content being published. Any websites producing content that Beijing does not like, run the risk of getting shut down and the people behind them face punishment or jail.China already operates what is often described as a \"Great Firewall\", which keeps its citizens from accessing websites Beijing deems to be undesirable or likely to undermine its political and economic goals.

Since the augmented-reality app launched in July, Pokemon Go has swept up gamers in a craze of monster-catching across the world. Just a week after its release in the US, Apple said the game had But now, a month since Pokemon Go\\\'s release, independent analysis suggests its popularity has plummeted. Some churn was only to be expected - the huge publicity it generated was always going to have attracted players who would briefly try it out and then set it aside.However, the drop-off occurred during a period when the app was launching across much of Asia and Latin America as well as France.No official figures on Pokemon Go\\\'s downloads have been made public, but according to data compiled by Axiom Capital Management, more than 10 million players have turned away since mid-July.Pokemon Go\\\'s Daily Active Users (DAUs) - an industry metric that determines how many people switch on an app each day - suggested that the game edged close to 45 million users on 17 July. By 16 August, that figure fell to just above 30 million.This would imply that Pokemon Go has lost more than 10 million daily active users in a month, which equates to nearly a quarter of its DAUs.  Crucially, this is during a phase where Pokemon Go was launching across Brazil, Indonesia, the Philippines and dozens of other countries, meaning that the fall in popularity had significantly offset growth in new territories.Pokemon Go\\\'s downloads, engagement, and time spent on the app per day are all in decline too, according to Axiom\\\'s data. Nevertheless, in Apple\\\'s UK App Store charts, Pokemon Go is currently in seventh place in the \"free\" category, and still in first place on the \"top-grossing\" chart. The game is similarly popular on Google\\\'s Play store. Nintendo, which owns about a third of The Pokemon Company, has seen its share price fall about 3% in the wake of Axiom\\\'s report. In the context of the volatility of Nintendo\\\'s share price in the past month, that 3% drop isn\\\'t too drastic. The Kyoto-based firm\\\'s valuation surged upon Pokemon Go\\\'s release and subsequently plummeted when it warned investors that the game\\\'s popularity wouldn\\\'t make a significant change to its revenues. Axiom senior analyst Victor Anthony said the decline should curb concerns that Pokemon Go would weaken the usage of other popular smartphone apps such as Instagram, Snapchat, and Twitter. In July, independent analysis of Android app usage showed that \"The declining trends should assuage investor concerns about the impact of Pokemon Go on time spent on [other apps],\" Mr Anthony Considering the finite capacity of Android and iOS owners, as well as the extraordinary speed with which Pokemon Go caught on, a decline in popularity of some kind was almost inevitable.\"It\\\'s rare for games to explode in popularity like Pokemon Go has, but a drop in users was always expected after a big launch,\" said Craig Chapple, editor of mobile games trade publication PocketGamer.Biz. He told the BBC: \"Players do typically churn from these free-to-play games. Another recent launch, Supercell\\\'s Clash Royale, is also being hit by a decline in active and paying users, but it\\\'s still making millions of dollars every day.\"However, the sheer speed with which Pokemon Go appears to be losing players should raise concerns, Mr Chapple said. \"The numbers, if accurate, do raise some questions about long-term retention in Pokemon Go - whether or not players are finding enough variety and fun in the core experience right now to stick with it.\"He added: \"But it\\\'s important to note it continues to be a top-grossing game in most countries, so players are still spending and enjoying it.\"It\\\'s difficult to say whether Pokemon Go\\\'s decline would have been so steep had its developer Niantic not removed a core feature from the game. At the start of August, ardent players aired their grievances at Niantic after the developer At the same time, Niantic also Axiom\\\'s data suggests the decline in Pokemon Go\\\'s popularity commenced mid-July - more than a week before the controversial removal of the nearby feature - but retention rates fell sharply following the update.Niantic was, by its own admission, caught off-guard by the sheer popularity of Pokemon Go, but it has pledged to continue supporting the game with bi-weekly updates. \"Running a product like Pokemon Go at scale is challenging,\" the developer recently For now, the game has yet to be released across many parts of Asia and Africa, which could improve its usage figures once the game arrives in those territories.However, Mr Chapple believes that fewer people playing Pokemon Go in the West could diminish the game\\\'s social aspect, which in turn would make it a less attractive game for those who stick around. \"Pokemon Go is unique.

When artists are alive, it is widely accepted that their word on whether a work is theirs or not is final. Mr Fletcher claimed Mr Doig had renounced the work to avoid admitting he had spent time in prison.He said he had bought the painting from Mr Doig for $100 in 1976 when the artist was serving a sentence for LSD possession at Thunder Bay Correctional Centre in Ontario, where Mr Fletcher was working. But Mr Doig insisted he had never been jailed and had actually been attending high school in Toronto at the time.He also said he was not using the kind of canvas the picture is painted on at that point in his career.

Each institution is also likely to face a further fine.The forex trading ban was triggered after the Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (NNPC) complained to President Buhari about the missing money, an NNPC spokesman told the BBC.Last year, President Buhari estimated government officials had stolen about $150bn in the previous decade.

Domestic bonds also fell as the cost of insuring debts in the credit default swaps market surged.A source told the Reuters news agency that Mr Gordhan and other former officials at the South African Revenue Service must report to the Hawks on Thursday morning.Speculation is rife that Mr Gordhan could be charged in connection with an alleged rogue spy unit that was set up at the tax collection agency when he headed it up between 1999 and 2009. Rumours of an arrest first emerged in local South African media back in May.Investigators sent Mr Gordhan a list of questions earlier this year, but he has always said the unit\\\'s work was above board and that he was unaware of any illegality connected with it.The developments and rumours have raised investors\\\' concerns over the leadership at the finance ministry of Africa\\\'s largest and most developed economy.In December last year, President Jacob Zuma sacked the then finance minister, Nhlanhla Nene, replacing him with a little-known MP, David van Rooyen. Financial markets and the currency tumbled following that decision and President Zuma was forced to remove Mr van Rooyen as finance minister and offer the job to Mr Gordhan. It was the second time Mr Gordhan had accepted the job - he was the finance minister before Mr Nene.South Africa\\\'s economy is teetering on the brink of recession, having recorded a contraction in the first quarter of this year. Figures for the second quarter are due out in early September. Should they also show a contraction, the economy will be technically in a recession.The country narrowly avoided a downgrade to junk status recently and the ratings agencies are due to give another assessment by the end of the year.Shadow finance minister David Maynier, of the opposition Democratic Alliance, says the arrest of Mr Gordhan would \"shatter investor confidence, risk a sovereign ratings downgrade and be a disaster for the already fragile zero growth, zero jobs economy in South Africa\".Earlier this month, the performance of the ruling African National Congress in South Africa\\\'s local elections was its worst since the end of apartheid 22 years ago.  Many analysts are saying that these events are part of the political endgame by President Zuma to oust Mr Gordhan. The reason seems to be the continuing tension between the Treasury and the Presidency over a Zuma-backed plan to build several nuclear power stations at a cost of some $60bn. Mr Gordhan has not publicly opposed the deal, which Russian companies are favoured to win, but keeps re-iterating that South Africa will only sign deals it can afford. It\\\'s thought that one of the main reasons Nhlanhla Nene was shown the door was that he refused to sign off on the nuclear deal. If the goal is to replace Mr Gordhan with someone more amenable to signing the cheques for the nuclear deal, logically soon is the time to do it. For the past six months, the rand had been gaining significantly against the US dollar (having slumped following Mr Nene\\\'s sacking last December). But the economic growth forecasts for this year remain bad - at best 1%, probably closer to zero - while unemployment remains stubborn high at more than 25%. For many analysts, precious little has been achieved or is likely to be achieved by the end of the year, when the credit rating agencies may well downgrade South Africa\\\'s sovereign debt to junk status.

In a draft letter to Mr Brittan in March 1984, in which Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was copied in, Mr Howe wrote: \"I think the consequences for the government could be very damaging if we laid ourselves open to the charge that this young girl was receiving special treatment, gifted and exceptional though she may be.\"The letter warned that the move could lead to possible withdrawals by other nations from the Olympic Games and the 1986 Edinburgh Commonwealth Games, and suggested it would undermine the Gleneagles agreement, a Commonwealth pact discouraging sporting contact with South Africa and be seen as a \"device to circumvent anti-apartheid politics\".It added: \"To give exceptional treatment to a South African national to enable her to avoid the sporting restrictions inflicted on her country and compete for Britain in the Olympics will be seen as a cynical move which will undermine that good faith.\"We will be open to charges by South Africa of double standards and duplicity.\"The file reveals a raft of concerns from the Foreign Office about the case, with officials in South Africa being inundated with immigration inquiries from other people with similar claims on citizenship to Budd.There were also concerns the government was \"giving in to chequebook journalism\" and commercial influences that had a stake in getting Budd to run in the Olympics, and that it was opening itself up to criticism by treating her as an exceptional case.In a reply, Mr Brittan said he understood the \"delicacy of the circumstances\", but added: \"It would be very difficult to defend a delay which led to her (Budd) being unable to attempt to qualify for the United Kingdom for this Olympics unless, as a government, we were prepared to state publicly that we would not take account of her apparent talent in judging whether priority should be given to the handling of her case.\"Zola Budd competed for South Africa at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics after the country was re-admitted to international competition following a referendum vote to end the apartheid system and the commitment to hold the country\\\'s first multi-racial election.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37167252','2016-08-24 23:55:30','2016-08-24 09:59:12',1),(560,'DR Congo elections: Opposition strike cripples Kinshasa','A strike called by the opposition in DR Congo to demand that the president steps down when his term ends cripples businesses in the capital.','A strike called by the opposition to force the Democratic Republic of Congo\\\'s President Joseph Kabila to step down at the end of his term has crippled businesses in the capital.Shops in Kinshasa were closed and streets were mostly empty, says the BBC\\\'s Poly Muzalia in the city.The government dismissed the strike as the work of \"radicals having some old fashioned fun\".The opposition fears Mr Kabila wants to delay elections due in November.Police also fired tear gas to disperse opposition supporters who had gathered in the capital.The one-day strike was most successful in Kinshasa, which has a population of about 11 million, our correspondent says.

A single shower can result in 100,000 plastic particles entering the ocean. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCosmetic companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 voluntary approach to phasing out plastic microbeads simply won\\xe2\\x80\\x99t wash. We need a full legal ban.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dMicrobeads are plastic particles smaller than 5mm. They are used in cosmetics, including toothpaste, to add body and provide abrasion. Manufacturers use them because the beads can be manufactured to uniform degrees of size and hardness.Other microplastics result from the breakup of larger plastic objects in the oceans \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like bags, bottles and discarded fishing gear. It is estimated that between 15-51 trillion microplastic particles have accumulated in the ocean.Microplastics from cosmetics are thought to constitute just 0.01% to 4.1% of plastics entering the marine environment. But the committee says that although microbeads are a small part of a huge problem, a ban would show commitment to tackling the wider issue.Microplastic pollution is potentially more environmentally damaging than larger plastic waste, because it is more likely to be eaten by wildlife. Microplastics also have a greater surface area to attract toxins. Professor Tamara Galloway from Exeter University said: \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe find pieces of plastic in every sample of seawater we study from round the world. Many marine animals ingest microbeads, mistaking them for food. They can then be lodged in the animals\\xe2\\x80\\x99 gut \\xe2\\x80\\x93 preventing them from eating nutritious food.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAn average plate of oysters could contain up to 50 plastic particles. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any evidence yet for the harm this might cause but most people would probably prefer not to be eating microbeads with their food.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe tiny synthetic fibres used to make fleece jackets are also contaminating fish, the MPs have warned. One estimate suggests around 1,900 individual fibres can be rinsed off a single synthetic garment - with perhaps 40% of them evading sewage treatment works and ending up in the ocean.This is ironic as fleece jackets are made of discarded plastic bottles, and have been considered a solution to waste plastic.The biggest single source of microplastics is estimated to be abrasion from car tyres and road markings. But this issue is likely to prove much more difficult to address than a relatively straightforward ban on microbeads in shampoo, where substitutes are readily available.Over 280 marine species have been found to ingest microplastics, but the MPs say much more research is needed into plastic pollution because there is huge uncertainty about the ecological risk.\"We are absolutely committed to protecting the world\\\'s seas, oceans and marine life from pollution, and will take a detailed look at the recommendations contained in this timely report,\" a spokesperson for the Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said.\"Many leading manufacturers have already taken voluntary steps to remove microbeads from cosmetics, beauty products and toothpastes.

The team says this is a proof-of-principal study, but suggests that perfumes have the potential to be used as trace evidence.The researchers, Lead researcher Simona Gherghel, from University College London, said:  \"We thought there was a lot of potential with perfume because a lot of people use  it. We know about 90% of women and 60% of men use perfume on a regular basis.\"While there is a lot of work in forensic science on transfers - for example, the transfer of fibres or the transfer of gun-shot residue - until now there has been no research on the transfer of perfumes.\"Perfumes are concocted from many different chemical components, which in combination give an individual fragrance its distinctive smell.The researchers, looking at a single male fragrance, found that some of these components were easily transferred from one piece of cotton to another.When the two pieces of material were pressed together for just a minute, 15 out of 44 chemical components were detected on the second piece of fabric.  If the contact time increased to 10 minutes, 18 components were measured. The scientists also tracked how time affected the transfer of the volatile compounds.They found that five minutes after an initial spray of fragrance, 24 out of 44 perfume components were detected on the second piece of fabric after it had been in contact for 10 minutes.  Six hours after the perfume was applied, 12 components were transferred and seven days later, six volatile components were retained.Dr Ruth Morgan, director of the UCL Centre for the Forensic Sciences, said: \"It is a pilot study and a proof-of-concept study. We\\\'ve shown that first, perfume does transfer, and second, we can identify when that transfer has happened. \"In the future there could well be situations where contact between two individuals is made and this is a way of discerning what kind of contact is made and when it was made.\"However the team added that any evidence would have to be collected extremely quickly after an offence, which could limit its usefulness. They said it was also unlikely that fragrance would be used alone to solve a case. Dr Morgan added: \"It is not going to be a one-stop indicator. In most investigations we would be hopeful that there would be multiple lines of investigation. We wouldn\\\'t want it to just be DNA or just a fingerprint or just perfume.

But he said the US had \"put a lid\" on any more such moves, creating a breathing space for the Jarablus operation, which the US supports and to which it is ready to contribute.President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced in a speech in Ankara: \"At 04:00 [01:00 GMT] our forces began an operation against the Daesh [IS] and PYD [Kurdish Democratic Union Party] terror groups.\" Operation Euphrates Shield was aimed at \"putting an end\" to problems on the border, he said.Between nine and 12 tanks crossed the border, followed by pick-up trucks believed to be carrying Turkish-backed Syrian rebels from the Free Syrian Army (FSA).The FSA said progress was slow because of mines planted by IS fighters in the area.

The prime minister has said she will not begin the formal legal process of separation by activating Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty this year, insisting that a \"sensible and orderly departure\" from the EU will take time.However, she has come under pressure from some senior Conservatives to begin the process in early 2017 amid press speculation about possible delays. Speaking on Wednesday, Mr Smith said the British people were \"lied to\" by those campaigning to leave the EU and they deserve to have a say on the terms of the exit.He told BBC Radio 5 live: \"It would be irresponsible of Theresa May to simply trigger Article 50 and sleepwalk out...

In the immediate aftermath of the referendum result, Mr Corbyn called for Article 50 to be invoked immediately but he has since distanced himself from the comments, saying he misspoke and due time was needed for the UK to determine its negotiating strategy.Article 50 gives the sides two years to negotiate the terms of the split, with any extension having to be agreed by all 28 EU members.At a campaign event in London, Mr Corbyn said: \"People voted for a variety of reasons, but nevertheless they voted.\"He set out what would be his \"red lines\" for Brexit, including full access to the EU single market, retention of workers\\\' rights and allowing EU nationals in the UK to remain.Sam Tarry, Mr Corbyn\\\'s campaign director, told BBC News Mr Smith\\\'s Article 50 pledge would cost Labour \"an awful lot of seats\".\"If he wants to use parliament to block, you know, us going into Brexit, I think that would be deeply unpopular with millions and millions of working class, potentially Labour, voters all across the country,\" Mr Tarry said.\"I think we need to have a bit more of a considered position.\"Most Labour MPs supported a vote to stay in the EU - but the Labour Leave campaign said Mr Smith\\\'s pledge was \"electoral suicide\".\"It is time for the Labour Party to put behind itself the divisions of the past and accept the result of the vote,\" said John Mills, Labour Leave\\\'s chairman.Sir Patrick McLoughlin, the chairman of the Conservative Party, said: \"The result of the referendum was clear and decisive and we in the Conservative Party will deliver on the people\\\'s verdict.\"Whether it\\\'s Jeremy Corbyn or Owen Smith, Labour are too divided and out of touch to make a success of Brexit.\"In his round of interviews, Mr Smith also faced questions about his use of the word \"lunatic\" at a campaign event.\"What you won\\\'t get from me is some lunatic at the top of the Labour Party,\" he told party members in Hammersmith.Mr Corbyn\\\'s campaign urged him to apologise, saying his comment was offensive to people with mental illness.Mr Smith told the Today programme he had not been referring to Mr Corbyn but had been referring to himself and apologised to anyone who was offended by the use of the word, saying his language would be \"less colourful in the future\".','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-37167253','2016-08-24 23:55:30','2016-08-24 18:41:44',1),(579,'Briton stabbed to death in Australia','A 21-year-old British woman dies and a man is severely injured in an Australian hostel knife attack.','A 21-year-old British woman has died after she was stabbed during an attack at a backpackers\\\' hostel in Australia.The victim has been named by friends as Mia Ayliffe-Chung, from Derbyshire.

Some buildings in the capital shook for 20 seconds as the quake struck the regional border area of Umbria, Lazio and Le Marche. It was felt from Bologna in the north of Italy to Naples in the south.

Accumoli is popular with holidaymakers and most of the 2,500 people left displaced by the earthquake were said to be visitors.Mr Renzi promised affected areas that \"no family, no city, no hamlet will be left alone\".Quakes are an ever-present danger for those who live along the Apennine mountain range in Italy. Through the centuries thousands have died as a result of tremors equal to, or not much bigger than, the event that struck in the early hours of Wednesday. The modern response, thankfully, has been more robust building and better preparation. Mediterranean seismicity is driven by the great collision between the African and Eurasian tectonic plates; but when it comes down to the specifics of this latest quake, the details are far more complicated. The Tyrrhenian Basin, or Sea, which lies to the west of Italy, between the mainland and Sardinia/Corsica, is slowly opening up. Scientists say this is contributing to extension, or \"pull-apart\", along the Apennines.  This stress is compounded by movement in the east, in the Adriatic.The result is a major fault system that runs the length of the mountain range with a series of smaller faults that fan off to the sides. The foundations of cities like Perugia and L\\\'Aquila stand on top of it all.Seismologist Andrea Tertulliani said there were sure to be further, numerous shocks that would probably diminish in intensity. \"But it can\\\'t be ruled out that there could be another shock on the same scale as the main one,\" he added.Italy\\\'s civil protection agency described the earthquake as \"severe\".\"It was so strong,\" Lina Mercantini of Ceselli, Umbria, told Reuters. \"It seemed the bed was walking across the room by itself with us on it.\"Please include a contact number if you are willing to speak to a BBC journalist.

That figure represented a 9.5% share of GDP, the report said - more than double the 4% figure for the UK as a whole. Revised figures for the previous year put the Scottish deficit at \\xc2\\xa314.3bn.The UK\\\'s spending deficit is \\xc2\\xa375.3bn.The Government Expenditure and Revenue Scotland (Gers) figures estimated that Scotland\\\'s share of North Sea revenues fell by about 97% from \\xc2\\xa31.8bn in 2014/15 to \\xc2\\xa360m last year, reflecting a decline in total UK North Sea revenue.But this fall was offset by Scotland\\\'s onshore revenues growing by \\xc2\\xa31.9bn.Overall, Scottish public sector revenue was estimated as \\xc2\\xa353.7bn - the equivalent of \\xc2\\xa310,000 per person, and about \\xc2\\xa3400 per person lower than for the UK as a whole. Meanwhile, total expenditure by the public sector was \\xc2\\xa368.6bn.This was equivalent to 9.1% of total UK public sector expenditure, and \\xc2\\xa312,800 per person - which is \\xc2\\xa31,200 per person greater than the UK average.The Gers figures for the 2014/15 financial year, which were published in March, estimated the Scottish deficit at \\xc2\\xa314.9bn, or 9.7% of GDP, including a geographic share of offshore tax revenue.But the latest report revised that figure down to \\xc2\\xa314.3bn, or 9.1% of Scottish GDP.First Minister Nicola Sturgeon insisted the \"foundations of the Scottish economy remain strong\".She added: \"The lower oil price has, of course, reduced offshore revenues, with a corresponding impact on our fiscal position - this underlines the fact that Scotland\\\'s challenge is to continue to grow our onshore economy.\"However, Scotland\\\'s long-term economic success is now being directly threatened by the likely impact of Brexit.\"The UK\\\'s government\\\'s Scottish secretary, David Mundell, said the figures \"show how being part of the UK protects living standards in Scotland\".Mr Mundell said: \"Scotland weathered a dramatic slump in oil revenues last year because we are part of a United Kingdom that has at its heart a system for pooling and sharing resources across the country as a whole.\"It is important that continues and the financial deal between the UK and Scottish governments, struck last year as part of the transfer of new tax and welfare powers to Holyrood, means real security for Scotland.\"This approach to estimating how much Scots pay in tax, and how much they benefit from spending at all levels of government, goes back to the early 90s. Conservative ministers in the Scottish Office thought it would help inform the debate on devolution, or at least it would help them make their case against a Scottish Parliament. The numbers would show, they thought, how much more Scotland gained from the Treasury than it sent south in tax revenues. That was one of those times when the oil price was low. Seven years earlier, it was very high and oil revenues were like a gusher.

That their immune system is altering their brain. The illness exacts a heavy toll on 350 million people around the world, among them Hayley Mason, from Cambridgeshire:\"My depression gets so bad that I can\\\'t leave the bed, I can\\\'t leave the bedroom, I can\\\'t go downstairs and be with my partner and his kids.The 30-year-old added: \"I can\\\'t have the TV on, I can\\\'t have noise and light, I have suicidal thoughts, I have self-harmed, I can\\\'t leave the house, I can\\\'t drive.\"And just generally I am completely confined to my own home and everything else just feels too much.\"Anti-depressant drugs and psychological treatments, like cognitive behavioural therapy, help the majority of people. But many don\\\'t respond to existing therapies and so some scientists are now exploring a new frontier - whether the immune system could be causing depression. \"I think we have to be quite radical,\" says Prof Ed Bullmore, the head of psychiatry at the University of Cambridge.He\\\'s at the forefront of this new approach: \"Recent history is telling us if we want to make therapeutic breakthroughs in an area which remains incredibly important in terms of disability and suffering then we\\\'ve got to think differently.\"The focus is on an errant immune system causing inflammation in the body and altering mood. And Prof Bullmore argues that\\\'s something we can all relate to, if we just think back to the last time we had a cold or flu.He said: \"Depression and inflammation often go hand in hand, if you have flu, the immune system reacts to that, you become inflamed and very often people find that their mood changes too.\"Their behaviour changes, they may become less sociable, more sleepy, more withdrawn.\"They may begin to have some of the negative ways of thinking that are characteristic of depression and all of that follows an infection.\"It is a subtle and yet significant shift in thinking. The argument is we don\\\'t just feel sorry for ourselves when we are sick, but that the chemicals involved in inflammation are directly affecting our mood. You can listen to The Inflamed Mind documentary on BBC Radio 4 at 21:00 BST and then Inflammation is part of the immune system\\\'s response to danger. It is a hugely complicated process to prepare our body to fight off hostile forces. If inflammation is too low then an infection can get out of hand. If it is too high, it causes damage. And for some reason, about one-third of depressed patients have consistently high levels of inflammation. Hayley is one of them: \"I do have raised inflammation markers, I think normal is under 0.7 and mine is 40, it\\\'s coming up regularly in blood tests.\"There is now a patchwork quilt of evidence suggesting inflammation is more than something you simply find in some depressed patients, but is actually the cause of their disease. That the immune system can alter the workings of the brain.To explore this revolutionary new idea in depression, we visited an arthritis clinic at Glasgow Royal Infirmary. It is perhaps an unexpected location, but it was in clinics like this that doctors noticed something unusual. Rheumatoid arthritis is caused by the immune system attacking the joints. And when patients were given precise anti-inflammatory drugs that calmed down specific parts of the immune response, their mood improved. Prof Iain McInnes, a consultant rheumatologist, said: \"When we give these therapies we see a fairly rapid increase in a sense of well-being, mood state improving quite remarkably often disproportionately given the amount of inflammation we can see in their joints and their skin.\"It suggests the patients were not simply feeling happier as they were in less pain, but that something more profound was going on. Prof McInnes added: \"We scanned the brains of people with rheumatoid arthritis, we then gave them a very specific immune targeted therapy and then we imaged them again afterwards.\"What we are starting to see when we give anti-inflammatory medicines is quite remarkable changes in the neuro-chemical circuitry in the brain. \"The brain pathways involved in mediating depression were favourably changed in people who were given immune interventions.\"One possible explanation is that inflammatory chemicals enter the brain. There they interrupt the production of serotonin - a key neurotransmitter that\\\'s linked to mood. About the self assessment: The first eight questions are taken from a measure known as the Patient Health Questionnaire 9 or PHQ-9, used by doctors to assess and monitor depression severity. The PHQ-9 was developed by Dr Robert L Spitzer, Dr Janet B W Williams, Dr Kurt Kroenke and colleagues, with an educational grant from Pfizer Inc.To hear more we visited Carmine Pariante\\\'s laboratory at King\\\'s College London. The professor of biological psychiatry has been piecing together the evidence on inflammation and depression for 20 years.He told the BBC: \"Nearly 30% to 40% of depressed patients have high levels of inflammation and in these people we think it is part of the causal process.\"The evidence supporting this idea is that high levels of inflammation are present even if someone is not depressed, but is at risk of becoming depressed.\"We know from studies that if you have high levels of inflammation today you\\\'re at higher risk of becoming depressed over the next weeks or months even if you are perfectly well.\" He\\\'s shown that not only are depressed patients more likely to have high levels of inflammation, but those with an overactive immune system are also less likely to respond to anti-depressants. This is a big deal because a third of patients don\\\'t get any benefit from drug treatments. But there\\\'s something confusing here. The immune system responds to infection and that doesn\\\'t seem to fit the usual story of depression. Take Jennifer Streeting, a trainee midwife in London, who traces her mental health problems back to when she was 14.\"My nana passed away and my mum had breast cancer and if you ask my therapist now she puts it down to grief and not really dealing with that at the time, I think there was just a lot going on.\" Prof Pariante argues it is actually these awful moments in our lives that change our immune system, priming it to increase the risk of depression years later.He said: \"We think the immune system is the key mechanism by which early life events produce this long-term effect.\"We have some data showing adult individuals who have a history of early life trauma, even if they have never been depressed, have an activated immune system so they are in a state of risk.\"The hope is that drugs targeting the immune system will provide much needed treatments for patients, particularly for those like Jennifer who seem to have tried them all.\"I had sertraline, I had Prozac, there was another one, I got started on citalopram, I was put on duloxetine, mirtazapine as well. I was on three at one point.\"She is now on a combination of drugs that seem to be working for her, but it has been a long journey. \"It is totally trial and error,\" said Prof Pariante.He added: \"We are not able to predict right from the beginning whether someone will respond.\"We think by measuring inflammation in the blood we\\\'ll actually be able to identify individuals that do require more complex, intensive antidepressant treatment, maybe a combination of an antidepressant and and anti-inflammatory.\" Most of us have common anti-inflammatories like ibuprofen at home, but doctors warn against experimenting at home, while clinical trials are taking place to prove whether this will work in patients.The world\\\'s largest medical research charity, the Wellcome Trust, has brought together universities and the pharmaceutical industry. The aim is to consolidate the evidence to accelerate the field; ultimately they want to find a new treatment for depression and develop a test to identify those who will benefit. Cambridge University\\\'s Prof Bullmore is leading the consortium. But we interviewed him at his other employer, GlaxoSmithKline.The company\\\'s immuno-inflammation laboratory is where scientists are developing new molecules which they hope will become effective medicines for inflammatory disorders.That process will take more than a decade, but Prof Bullmore says there may already be a drug out there.\"One of the exciting things about immunopsychiatry is that because of the success of immunology in other areas of medicine there are already many drugs that are far beyond this stage of development.\"They may already be licensed or in late-stage clinical trials so the timeline from start of work on that project to delivering a medicine that might make a difference to patients could be much shorter.\" Raiding the cupboards is already showing signs of success. Those early clues in arthritis mean the anti-inflammatory drug sirukumab is now being trialled in depressed patients.So are drugs targeting the immune system about to transform the treatment of depression?Prof Bullmore argues: \"I don\\\'t think they are going to be a panacea, I don\\\'t think we\\\'re talking about a scenario in future where every patient with symptoms of depression is going to be offered an anti-inflammatory drug.\"I don\\\'t think that makes sense and frankly that sort of blockbuster one-size-fits-all approach to development of drugs for psychiatry has not been helpful to us in the past.\"We have to take a more personalised or stratified approach, not everyone that is depressed is depressed for the same reason.\"That will require a blood test to identify which patients will benefit from immune-based therapies. Depression is a disease that affects hundreds of millions of people. Even if anti-inflammatories help just a small proportion of them - that would still be a huge number of patients. But if immunotherapy becomes a success, its biggest impact may be on the way we think about the disease, making people less likely to believe sufferers should just \"pull themselves together\". \"I hate that phrase, if I could I would,\" says Jennifer.She adds: \"Just as if someone had diabetes and their insulin levels weren\\\'t working correctly, you wouldn\\\'t say, \\\'Oh snap out of it, stop having a hypo.\\\'\"Hayley feels the same: \"If there was a way to say depression was a physical problem I think it would make a massive difference, I think people would treat depression as something that is not made up and going on in the head. \"It would be seen as a genuine condition, it would validate a lot of people\\\'s feelings.\"Prof Pariante concludes: \"It is groundbreaking because, for the first time, we are demonstrating that depression is not only a disorder of the mind, in fact it is not even only a disorder of the brain, it is a disorder of the whole body.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37166293','2016-08-24 23:55:30','2016-08-24 08:43:20',1),(592,'HIV effort let down by test shortages, says WHO','A shortage of HIV testing could undermine global efforts to diagnose and treat people with the infection, warn experts from the World Health Organization.','A shortage of HIV testing could undermine global efforts to diagnose and treat people with the infection, warn experts from the World Health Organization. They looked at responses to annual surveys that the WHO had sent to 127 countries between 2012 and 2014 asking about capacity and usage of blood tests that check HIV status and health. They found worrying gaps in provision.They warn that United Nation targets for HIV could be missed as a result. The targets say that by 2020, 90% of all people living with HIV should know their HIV status, 90% of those diagnosed should receive antiretroviral therapy and 90% of these treated patients should have \"durable viral suppression\" (a measure of effective treatment). Laboratory testing is vital to meet and monitor these aims. But Vincent Habiyambere and his colleagues say in the journal PLoS Medicine that some low and middle-income countries, including African countries where the HIV burden is high, are not yet geared up for the challenge. The surveys were sent to:\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 all 47 countries in the WHO African Region \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 33 countries in the WHO Region of the Americas \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 all 21 countries in the WHO Eastern Mediterranean Region\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 eight high-burden HIV countries in the WHO European Region\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 all 11 countries in the WHO South-East Asia Region\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 seven high-burden HIV countries in the WHO Western Pacific Region Over the three survey years, 55 (43%) countries responded to all three surveys, 35 (28%) to two surveys, 25 (20%) to one survey, and nine (7%) responded to none of the three surveys.Testing provision did improve over the years, but shortfalls remained in some parts of the world.Reasons for the gaps in provision included lack of reagents, equipment not being installed or maintained properly and inadequate or absent staff training. In some laboratories, machines were not serviced regularly. In others, machines broke down and were not covered by contracts to be serviced or fixed. Dr Habiyambere and his team say: \"A national laboratory strategic plan to strengthen services must be developed, implemented, and monitored by governments and their national and international partners.\"The focus of the international community, to ensure optimal use of laboratory technologies, should be on those countries where interventions for scaling up access to HIV diagnostic technologies are most needed.\"They acknowledge that they did not look at private sector testing and that some countries might rely more heavily on this than others. In an accompanying editorial, HIV experts Peter Kilmarx and Raiva Simbi say the findings show some programmes may have been \"overly focused\" on buying equipment without planning for how it would be used and maintained. In Zimbabwe, for example, only 5.6% of HIV patients on drug treatment in 2015 received regular blood checks to monitor their viral load - far fewer than the goal of 21%. This was largely down to problems with resource mobilisation and specimen transport as well as equipment procurement, they say. \"Strong leadership, resources, planning, and management are needed to scale up laboratory services,\" they conclude.

The data does not currently suggest borrowing patterns have been significantly affected by the Brexit vote, but it is still early days. Many borrowing decisions will also have been taken before the referendum,\" said Rebecca Harding, chief economist at the BBA.\"We are also clearly still a nation of shoppers and the Brexit vote has done nothing to change the fact that we use credit cards for short-term purchases. Strong retail sales figures appear closely associated with strong consumer credit growth.\"Many economists have predicted that the UK economy will grow slower than previously expected as a result of the UK\\\'s decision to leave the EU.This, in part, led to the Bank of England\\\'s decision to cut interest rates to a new record low of 0.25% in August. Part of the theory of an interest rate cut is to encourage consumers to spend rather than save.The BBA figures cover a period that pre-dates this rate cut, but the organisation suggests that people were still willing to buy in the shops on credit cards, before quickly repaying nearly all of this borrowing shortly afterwards.Borrowing by consumers, excluding mortgage borrowing, rose by 6% in July compared with the same month a year earlier.The BBA also said gross mortgage borrowing hit \\xc2\\xa312.6bn in July, 6% higher than a year earlier.However, the total of 37,662 mortgages approved for house purchases in July was down 5% on the previous month, and 12% lower than the average of the previous six months.This could suggest that those planning to buy a home may have taken a wait-and-see approach with home loan applications during the referendum campaign.Figures from HM Revenue and Customs, published on Thursday, showed that property sales had ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37173229','2016-08-24 23:55:30','2016-08-24 17:21:23',1),(606,'Why did Sir Richard Branson take on Jeremy Corbyn?','Why did Sir Richard Branson plunge into a row with Jeremy Corbyn - and why nearly a week after the incident?','A public attack on a politician is a risky gambit for a businessperson, even when they are as well-known and publicly admired as Virgin tycoon Sir Richard Branson. Bankers, energy company bosses and most recently Sir Philip Green bear the scars of clashes with elected representatives in which the private sector normally comes off worse.On Tuesday, however, Branson took on Jeremy Corbyn over his claims he hadn\\\'t been able to find a seat on a Virgin train. Branson tweeted stills from CCTV footage that appeared to show the Labour leader walking past empty seats on his way to record a video lamenting the poor service provided by the privatised railway. Now Why did Branson plunge in - and why nearly a week after the incident?  There are some interesting pieces of context that might explain why the Virgin boss was so keen to get involved.First, Branson has never been slow to fight off attacks on his - and Virgin\\\'s credibility. Two decades ago he staked his reputation in two high-profile libel trials, the first against British Airways over the \"dirty tricks\" affair, and the second against Guy Snowden, then chairman of the American gambling technology company GTech.  Branson said Snowden had offered him a bribe, and won the ensuing trial, as he did the case against British Airways.Second, Corbyn\\\'s call for rail nationalisation is one of the few of his policies that has an appeal to a wide range of voters. Privatisation has seen record numbers of passengers, new trains and the revival of what was a declining mode of transport, but it has also brought high fares, fat cats and, recently, damaging strikes that have paralysed commuter routes. There is a common feeling that nationalisation, a return to the \"good old days\" of British Rail, would make the problems go away.Branson and his fellow private rail operators - notably Stagecoach, which owns 90% of the Virgin East Coast franchise where Corbyn tried to find a seat - are eager to kill this idea as quickly as possible. An attack on its most vocal proponent fits the bill.Third, the east coast line is under financial pressure. Stagecoach recently described its performance as \"challenging\" which may be an understatement.  It and Branson promised to pay the government a \\xc2\\xa33bn premium over the life of the franchise, a promise that analysts think will require the company to hit annual revenue growth targets of 8-12%. The best estimate is that it is achieving only half that. The east coast has been a graveyard for previous operators - both GNER and National Express had to hand back the keys after making over-optimistic promises on revenue.One other factor may have weighed on Branson\\\'s mind. The old enemy - British Airways - had a fantastic day of PR yesterday, with a 747 sporting a gold nose cone carrying the British Olympic team back from the Brazil games. It\\\'s not far-fetched to speculate that Branson, itching for an opportunity to knock BA out of the headlines, spied the row with Corbyn, and felt the opportunity too good to miss.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-37175038','2016-08-24 23:55:30','2016-08-24 18:01:53',1),(607,'Tesla\'s Elon Musk says new car battery is a milestone','Tesla Motors unveils a new battery pack for its cars that boss Elon Musk says marks a profound milestone for the speed and distance of its electric vehicles.','Tesla Motors has unveiled a new battery pack for the performance versions of its Model S and X cars that will extend the range and mean faster acceleration.Elon Musk, chief executive of the electric car maker, hailed the upgraded battery as a \"profound milestone\".He said the battery cell chemistry is the same, but the reconfigured product stored more energy in the same space. Tesla, which this month posted a steeper-than-expected loss, is adding a new sedan car to its sports line-up.Mr Musk claimed that the new 100-kilowatt hour battery pack means high-end versions of the Model S sedan, called the P100D, will be the world\\\'s fastest accelerating car in production.It will do 0-60mph in 2.5 seconds.

Mr Musk said that in cool weather, a driver could travel from San Francisco to Los Angeles - a nearly 400 mile drive - without recharging.In May, Tesla said it was stepping up production plans for its upcoming Model 3 mass-market sedan and would build a total of 500,000 all-electric vehicles in 2018, two years ahead of schedule.

On a busy train, what is the deal with sitting in reserved but empty seats?','Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has been criticised after being filmed sitting on the floor on a Virgin train when there were apparently seats available. So, on a busy train, can you sit in reserved but empty seats?On a typical British inter-city train there may only be a couple of carriages that are designated unreserved. In the other carriages, many of the seats will be marked as reserved.And yet, they are often empty.   \"When you book online, you [typically] automatically get a seat reservation whether you ask for it or not,\" says Mark Smith, who runs The Man In Seat Sixty-One rail website. The traveller with an open ticket frequently decides not to get the train for which they had a reservation. If they were booked onto a specific train and miss it, their seat is still marked as reserved. You are allowed to sit in reserved seats that are not occupied. If you speak to a conductor on a busy train they will tell you to do this. It\\\'s usually obvious a few minutes after departure that the person who made the reservation is not coming. But the problem is there is no sign that tells you to do this. So even on busy trains people will walk past empty reserved seats. There\\\'s a further confusion when someone places belongings in an otherwise unoccupied empty seat next to theirs.For socially reserved Britons it\\\'s not an easy situation, says social historian Joe Moran, author of Shrinking Violets: A field guide to shyness.\"I think on Virgin trains it is often very ambiguous. One of the things shy people have a problem with is social ambiguity - if things aren\\\'t clear. There might be a bag on it, people might have gone to the toilet.\" There\\\'s a slightly different situation in much of the rest of Europe. \"On the continent you have to take up your seat within 15 minutes of departure,\" says Smith. German IC and ICE trains have electronic displays which initially show a seat as reserved, but which then go blank 15 minutes after departure from the station where the reservation starts. So if unclaimed after 15 minutes, the seat can be used.  \"I find this annoying if I\\\'m travelling solo and want to go to the bistro, as I may return to find my reserved seat occupied unless I leave it covered with belongings, but it does solve the problem of reserved seats not being claimed,\" says Smith.And there are systems like France\\\'s TGV where you must book on to a particular train with a seat reservation to travel. If a train is fully booked, you can\\\'t travel on it and have to try to book on a later train. There is no standing.But there are inter-city trains in the UK where people cannot sit down at all. It\\\'s all the fault of the fare structure, says Smith. The system of peak and off-peak walk-on tickets puts massive pressure on the first train after peak time ends. \"The 19:00 goes out with people hanging out the door. But the 20:00 is empty,\" he explains.  That wouldn\\\'t explain why Jeremy Corbyn\\\'s train may have been, as he put it, \"ram-packed\", though.\"This whole thing blew up on the 11:00 [London to Newcastle]. If it was rammed something strange is going on,\" says Smith.

They cover events in the 1980s running up to 1989. The files come from the Public Record Office of Northern Ireland (PRONI).They have been released under what is known as the 30/20 rule, which refers to the phased release of files that used to be kept secret for 30 years but will in future be released after 20 years.With IRA bombs exploding and frequent loyalist murders, the men of violence appeared to be setting the agenda in the 1980s. But the files reveal tentative efforts to get talks underway. The British government was concerned that John Hume did not seem convinced by its attempts to convene cross-party negotiations. Officials identified Representatives from the parties - including the DUP\\\'s Peter Robinson - met in secret in Duisburg, Germany in 1988. The files show that Northern Ireland Office Minister Brian Mawhinney thanked the organiser, a German clergyman called Eberhard Spiecker, at a meeting four months later. Historian Eamon Phoenix said that the official report of the meeting showed that the government regarded Dr Spiecker as well meaning but harboured doubts \"as to how much he really knew about the Northern Ireland political scene\". However, Dr Spiecker summarised the \"Duisburg proposal\" as a break in governmental meetings connected to the Anglo-Irish Agreement, which unionists had demanded, while acknowledging that so far as the SDLP was concerned \"there must be a chance of an all-Ireland dimension\".   Dr Spiecker confimed to the minister there had been a fifth person involved, who he said had a difficult role to play - representing the views of the republican movement, but remaining acceptable to the unionists.

Dr Phoenix came across one strongly worded document from April 1987 written by Sir Ken Bloomfield, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service.Sir Ken spoke of west Belfast\\\'s \"ghetto mentality\" and alienation \"from normal civilised behaviour\".He feared that if the government engaged in efforts to regenerate West Belfast, unionists might respond \"on the lines of \"do you have to kill British soldiers... to benefit from a cornucopia of assistance?\"Despite these concerns, the government signed off on a major development programme for deprived areas in Belfast in 1988.Several documents refer to the government\\\'s difficulties combating the influential MacBride principles, an anti-discrimination campaign in the USA that acted as guidelines for US companies doing business in Northern Ireland. Secretary of State Peter Brooke wrote to cabinet colleagues that the implementation of what he called tough and radical new fair employment laws would be crucial to the success of the government\\\'s Northern Ireland policies and to perceptions abroad, especially in the United States.

It comes as net migration estimates show it remains near record levels, at 327,000 for the year to March.The Net migration is the difference between the number of people coming to the UK for at least a year and those leaving.There were an estimated 831,000 Polish-born residents in 2015 - a jump of almost 750,000 compared with the number in 2004, the year the country joined the EU. India and the Republic of Ireland have traditionally been the sources of the UK\\\'s largest foreign-born groups.The latest net migration figures show a slowdown in the numbers settling in the UK from Poland and seven other former Eastern bloc countries - but that was offset by an increase in net migration from Bulgaria and Romania, which hit record levels of 60,000.Nicola White, ONS Head of International Migration Statistics, said: \"Net migration remains at record levels although the recent trend is broadly flat. \"The influx of Romanians and Bulgarians has also reached a new high, although that\\\'s off-set by falls in non-EU immigration and from other central and eastern European countries. \"Work remains the main reason for migration, followed by study which has seen a significant fall in the number of people coming to the UK for education.\"It\\\'s important to remember that these figures only go up to the end of March and do not cover the period following the UK\\\'s vote to leave the European Union.\"She said the UK\\\'s population continued to increase between 2014 and 2015, driven by \"significant increases in both the non-UK born and non-British national population of the UK\".The region with the highest proportion of non-UK born residents, at 37%, is London.More than 25% of births in England and Wales in 2015 were to women born outside the UK, the highest level on record, ONS statistician Elizabeth McLaren said: \"The rising percentage of births to women born outside the UK is largely due to foreign born women making up an increasing share of the female population of childbearing age in England and Wales. \"Part of the reason for this is that migrants are more likely to be working-age adults rather than children or older people. Alongside their increasing share of the population, higher fertility among women born outside the UK has also had an impact.\"The immigration statistics contain few surprises, with net migration still a long, long way from the government\\\'s target.

The think tank has also released a survey suggesting almost half of Britons do not believe the government will reach its net migration targets.Ministers have pledged to reduce net migration to below 100,000 by 2020.British Future\\\'s report is published ahead of the release on Thursday of the latest net migration figures.Details of the number of people coming to the UK for more than a year from across the EU and the rest of the world will be published at 09:30 BST - covering the year to 31 March.Net migration - the difference between the estimated number of people settling in the UK and those emigrating - rose to 333,000 in 2015, the second highest figure on record, and has been above 300,000 for the past five quarters.Prime Minister Theresa May has said she is sticking with her predecessor David Cameron\\\'s target of bringing the annual figure down to less than 100,000 - even though he fell well short of this during the last Parliament.Opposition parties and some Tories have called for the target to be ditched, arguing it is distorting priorities and will be unachievable even outside the EU. But ministers say it is still a valid benchmark for \"sustainable\" migration levels.In its report, British Future - which describes itself as a non-partisan body focused on addressing issues of migration, integration and identity - said the target was a \"symbolic totem\" for many and the failure to meet it had damaged public trust but it was unlikely to be reconsidered until the shape of the UK\\\'s Brexit deal became apparent.\"After the referendum, the debate about the future of the headline target will have little practical impact until the contours of future UK immigration policy become clearer,\" it wrote. \"Nobody in government or outside of it could possibly be in a position to make a sensible long-term judgement about future immigration targets without knowing more about the Brexit deal itself, about prevailing conditions in the UK economy and their impact on inward and outward flows.\"Instead, policymakers should focus on coming up with \"workable alternatives\" for presenting their objectives pending what it said should be a far-reaching review of immigration goals and a \"national conversation\" about future options.\"Britain\\\'s current immigration system is broken and is not working for anybody,\" it said. \"Leaving the EU will have a major impact on almost all aspects of immigration policy.\"While Brexit will present challenges for decision-makers, it also offers and opportunity to get policy right in this area and to help secure consent for the immigration that we have.\"Meanwhile, British Future\\\'s survey of 2,400 people says 44% of those polled said the target was unlikely to be met in the next five years - even after Britain withdraws from the European Union.  But 37% still thought the target was likely to be achieved.  Sunder Katwala, director of the think-tank, said: \"Public trust in governments\\\' competence to manage immigration - including meeting its own targets - is at rock bottom.\"During the referendum, Leave campaigners said exiting the EU would allow the UK to determine who came into the country but mostly stopped short of saying greater controls would result in a fall in immigration.Brexit negotiations, which will not begin in earnest until the start of 2017 at the earliest, are likely to hinge on to what extent continued access to EU markets can be squared with limits on immigration from the EU. Thursday\\\'s report said it would be unacceptable for there to be no restrictions on the right of other EU citizens to come to live and work in the UK given the strong public support for this.And while the public broadly accepted the need for employers to be allowed to continue to recruit highly skilled migrants from across the world, it said, economic arguments for migration had fallen on deaf ears during the referendum and must be reconsidered - with more priority given to managing the consequent social pressures.As well as giving local authorities funding to mitigate the impact of immigration on public services, it said, more emphasis must be placed on helping integrate migrants in their new communities and bodies should be set up in all cities and regions with devolved mayors to coordinate approaches.Another think tank, the left-leaning Institute for Public Policy Research, said the net migration target should simply be abandoned in favour of separate targets for low-skilled and high-skilled immigration.\"They say the definition of madness is repeating the same thing and expecting a different result,\" its associate director Phoebe Griffith said.\"Yet the government continue to stand by a net migration target that neither the public nor many ministers have confidence in.\"Having a net migration target is like having a target for the number of sunny days in a year; it\\\'s not going to change the weather by itself. \"The government need to design policy to balance public concerns with the needs of different sectors of our economy.\"The IPPR\\\'s own research suggests there are currently about 55,000 EU nationals working in the English NHS, with one in 10 of the UK\\\'s registered doctors an EU national, and the health service would \"collapse\" without them.It said all EU nationals who work for, or as locums in, the NHS should be eligible to apply for British citizenship.

Three months into 2016-17, and the accounts look much rosier.But the message from within the health service is don\\\'t be fooled. First, NHS trusts have an incentive to be optimistic at this early stage - it allows them to access the \\xc2\\xa31.8bn \"bailout\" pot set aside for them.Secondly, in the coming years the budget rises for the NHS will be much smaller than the one seen this year. Unless something is done to stem the rise in demand being seen, a return to large overspends seems inevitable, many believe.But despite the improvement, hospital bosses warned the heath service was not yet out of the woods.A survey by NHS Providers, which represents NHS trusts, found a number of finance directors were still struggling despite the cash injection.Some 84 finance directors - a third of the total - took part with one in five saying they were in a worse position than expected.And nearly four in 10 said they did not think they could meet the financial targets that had been set by regulators for this year, with another third unsure whether they could.NHS Providers chief executive Chris Hopson said it was \"positive news\" that the runaway deficits had slowed after the record \\xc2\\xa32.45bn overspend posted at the end of 2015-16.But he said the survey showed things could still deteriorate in the future. \"These findings show the strain NHS trusts are operating under. There is now a clear and widening gap between what the NHS is required to deliver and the funding available.\"And he predicted the situation would \"only get worse\" in the coming years as the annual budget increases for the rest of the Parliament after 2016-17 were going to be much more modest than the \\xc2\\xa33.8bn extra put in this year, which had allowed ministers to set aside the \\xc2\\xa31.8bn pot specially for NHS trusts.He said in the long term, the \"sums simply don\\\'t add up\" and called for a debate about funding and what the NHS could and should provide.Richard Murray, of the King\\\'s Fund think tank, said while the financial figures had improved, performance on many other measures such as waiting times was worsening, with hospital bed occupancy \"eye-wateringly high\".','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37179563','2016-08-25 22:30:05','2016-08-25 20:28:02',1),(644,'\'Unsafe\' Stafford hospital A&E closed to children','Children\'s accident and emergency services at a troubled hospital are suspended after senior staff said it was \"not clinically safe\".','Children\\\'s accident and emergency services at a troubled hospital have been suspended after senior staff said it was \"not clinically safe\".A shortage of staff with the right specialist training at Stafford\\\'s County Hospital had forced the closure to patients under 18, the trust said.The hospital, under its former guise of Stafford Hospital, was the subject of a The A&E department is open to adults.Robert Francis QC, who led the public inquiry and which sat for a year between 2010 and 2011, Some patients were left \"sobbing and humiliated\" due to The trust which ran the then Stafford Hospital was dissolved and a new one, University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust, was created in November 2014.In July 2015, the CQC said the trust \\\'required improvement\\\' and in March 2016 it was reported it was facing fines of up to \\xc2\\xa39m for failing to meet government targets.Consultant-led maternity care was also moved from County Hospital in July to the Royal Stoke University Hospital, when the new trust started running.Liz Rix, chief nurse and acting deputy chief executive, said it was \"a difficult short-term decision\" to suspend the children\\\'s A&E service, which deals with about 30 children a day.She said: \"I fully appreciate the impact these temporary changes will have on families in Stafford and the surrounding area, and understand that people will be very concerned about this news. \"However, we cannot and will not continue to deliver services without the confidence that those services are safe.\"Stafford MP Jeremy Lefroy said he was \"deeply disappointed\" by the closure.Stafford Borough Council leader Patrick Farrington said the situation was \"unacceptable\" and \"devastating\" for parents.\"This service must be reinstated as soon as it is safe to do so,\" he said.Cheryl Porter, from Support Stafford Hospital, said the service was \"very well run\" and should not be moved.\"They took our children\\\'s services away today,\" she said.\"I\\\'ve personally used it in the last few weeks.\"Concerns have been raised about what impact the closure will have on neighbouring services.Ruth Smeeth, MP for Stoke-on-Trent North, said services in North Staffordshire were already running at high capacity.She said: \"Our health economy is as stretched as it could possibly be, and this is only going to add to the challenges we currently face.\"Ian Syme, from campaign group North Staffordshire Healthwatch, said it was \"the right thing to do\" to suspend services if there were not enough paediatricians, however, he warned hospitals in nearby areas, such as Stoke-on-Trent and Wolverhampton, could face a \"surge\" in demand.He said: \"I can understand the fears of the people in the Stafford area, but [suspending services] is the safest of the options.\"A University Hospitals of North Midlands NHS Trust spokesman said the suspension would not cause problems with capacity at other hospitals in the trust, adding Royal Stoke University Hospital was already the centre for children needing specialist care.I understand having spoken to some staff that they were told by email this morning, and there has been a meeting talking to staff about the reasons for this sudden change.This has happened before in other areas such as Redditch -

With steaks, any harmful bacteria sit on the surface of cuts of meat and can be killed off by searing or cooking, even if the middle is left rare. Burger meat, on the other hand, is minced and mixed together, so harmful bugs can get to the centre of the meat and will not be killed unless heated to the right temperature. Officials says this advice holds even for expensive burgers or products labelled as \"steak burgers\". And burgers should be cooked until the juices run clear. Some restaurants do serve burgers that are rare, but their chefs must follow strict rules. Bacteria such as salmonella and E. coli present on animals\\\' hides or guts can get on to the surface of meat as it is being cut and prepared for sale. And once meat is minced, these bugs can end up in the middle of burgers. Although bacteria need heat to grow, this tends to happen at between 8 and 60C.  Above 60C bacteria start to die. Cooking also causes proteins in bacteria to break up. These proteins need to be heated for long enough and at high enough temperatures for them to break down, rendering the bacteria harmless. The usual hygiene advice applies - store uncooked meat separately from cooked meat.Raw chicken must not be washed, experts warn. FSA advice also suggests pre-cooking chicken in the oven before finishing it on the barbecue. And it says the same advice can be applied when cooking sausages, burgers and kebabs for large numbers of people. Meanwhile, disposable barbecues may need extra attention as they can take longer to heat up to the required temperature.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-37174082','2016-08-25 22:30:05','2016-08-25 09:10:42',1),(646,'Rotavirus infections \'greatly reduced\' since vaccine','Rotavirus infections have fallen by 84% in England since a vaccine has been offered to young babies, figures from Public Health England suggest.','Rotavirus infections fell by 84% in England since a vaccine for babies was introduced in 2013, figures from Recorded cases dropped from an average of 14,510 a year in the decade before the vaccine was introduced to just 2,287 between July 2015 and June 2016.

The announcement was broadcast live on Wednesday from Havana, Cuba, where peace talks have been held for almost four years. The conflict has killed an estimated 260,000 people and displaced millions.President Juan Manuel Santos called the deal \"the beginning of the end to the suffering, pain and tragedy of war\". \"The Colombian government and the Farc announce that we have reached a final, full and definitive accord,\" Colombian government and Farc negotiators said in a joint statement.The head of the Colombian delegation, Humberto de la Calle, and the chief Farc negotiator, Ivan Marquez, signed the agreement at a ceremony in Cuba.Both sides have agreed to work together to address social exclusion, to deliver justice to the victims of the conflict and build a stable and enduring peace. The agreement comes after two years of secret talks and almost four years of formal negotiations.\"We have reached our goal,\" said Mr de la Calle. \"The war is over but also there is also new beginning. This agreement opens the door to a more inclusive society,\" he added.In Bogota, hundreds of people, many dressed in white, gathered at different points of the city waving the Colombian flag and cheering.\"I can die in peace because finally I\\\'ll see my country without violence with a future for my children,\" 57-year-old Orlando Guevara told the Associated Press news agency.Farc negotiator Ivan Marquez said the Farc and the government had \"won the most beautiful of all battles: the peace of Colombia\".Together, the once bitter enemies stood - guerrilla leaders and former generals, foot soldiers and career diplomats - and sang the Colombian national anthem. In the end their shared understanding of what Colombia is, appears to have won out over their sharp differences as the two sides took their seats to announce the end of almost five decades of fighting. It has taken nearly four years of talks, which on several occasions looked on the verge of collapse. The question now, as the peace process moves from Havana back to Bogota, is whether the terms agreed in Havana will be acceptable to the Colombian people.The two sides had signed a bilateral ceasefire in June, paving the way for a final agreement.\"It has been a difficult job, with bright and dark moments,\" added Mr Marquez. President Barack Obama phoned his Colombian counterpart, Juan Manuel Santos, to congratulate him on the deal.\"The president recognised this historic day as a critical juncture in what will be a long process to fully implement a just and lasting peace agreement that can advance security and prosperity for the Colombian people,\" said the White House in a statement.Under the terms of the agreement, the Farc will give up its armed struggle and join the legal political process. \"There is no room for winners or losers when you achieve peace through negotiations,\" tweeted Farc negotiator Rodrigo Granda. \"Colombia wins, death loses.\"The left-wing rebels have been fighting Colombian government since 1964. It is the longest-running conflict in Latin America.The deal will need to be approved by Colombians in a popular vote, which will take place on 2 October, Mr Santos announced.\"It will be the most important election of our lives,\" he said on national television shortly after the deal was signed.Former President Alvaro Uribe is leading the campaign to get the agreement rejected.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-latin-america-37180752','2016-08-25 22:30:05','2016-08-25 17:38:09',1),(648,'The ‘handsome weeping boys’ paid to wipe away your tears','Japanese companies are paying for employees to attend \"crying workshops\".','There are about 10 of us sitting in a conference room in an office block in Tokyo and a man has just put on a selection of film clips.As the music blares from tinny-sounding speakers, a heart-rending story about a deaf man and his daughter begins. The daughter is struck down with a terrible illness and is rushed to hospital. The man, unable to communicate that he is her father, is not allowed past the reception desk. The film ends with him crying inconsolably as she dies alone.As the second film - about a fatally ill dog - starts, I hear a muffled sob from the other side of the room. Minutes later, there are some loud sniffing noises to my right. Within 15 minutes, half of the room is staring at the screen, tears streaming down their faces.Hear Emily Webb\\\'s report on Japan\\\'s \"handsome weeping boys\" for Outlook on BBC World Service on The man showing the films begins to walk around and, with a large cotton handkerchief, softly wipes the tears from people\\\'s faces. He diligently refolds the handkerchief for each person to offer them a dry patch.\"When I started running these workshops, there were some quite awkward moments,\" the man with the handkerchief, Ryusei, tells me. He has model good looks and is taking his tear-wiping role very seriously. \"I wasn\\\'t practised enough and so couldn\\\'t cry easily and this would mean the audience couldn\\\'t cry either. But it\\\'s much better now, I can cry and so others follow.\" His job title is somewhat unusual: ikemeso danshi, or \"handsome weeping boy\". He runs sessions with the sole purpose of making people cry.  \"Japanese are not used to crying in front of people. But once you cry in front of others, the environment will change, particularly in a business.\" The idea is to show off your vulnerability - when others see that, it\\\'s supposed to bring people together so they work better as a team.Most of the films he plays focus on ill pets or father-daughter relationships, and appear to be targeted at women. I\\\'m told that anyone can come along but today, all but one of the attendees are female. The sole man is the company boss who arranged the session.Companies can choose from a selection of handsome weeping boys. One is a trained dentist who does this as a sideline, while others play the part of a gymnast, a funeral director or shoe shiner.Today\\\'s facilitator, Ryusei, is known as a \"good-looking-but-slightly-older weeping boy\" - the others are in their 20s while he is nudging 40. In Tokyo, other companies have launched similar projects. Non-sexual cuddling sessions and rent-a-friend services are already available in town. The crying workshops were Hiroki Terai\\\'s idea - he\\\'s a businessman determined to get Japanese people to express their emotions, \"I have always been interested in the hidden sagas of human beings,\" he says. It all began when he was 16. With no friends at school, Hiroki ate his lunch in a toilet cubicle, alone. It was a difficult time: \"It was around then I feel I started to find out more about people\\\'s real emotions - on the surface they\\\'re smiling but that\\\'s not always how they feel.His first project was running divorce ceremonies for couples whose marriages have broken down, \"The climax of the ceremony is crushing the wedding ring with a hammer.\" The couples said that crying was the most cathartic moment. Hiroki therefore decided to set up a crying business in 2013. It started with workshops open to everyone in Tokyo.\"People would come and cry together. When they cried they said they felt really good afterwards,\" he says. \"The only problem was the perception of crying men. People thought they were weepy or wimps.\"  Hiroki\\\'s solution? Crying workshops led by handsome men. He wanted to bring the image of crying men into the mainstream while using those men to make other people cry. I asked him why the men have to be good looking. He shrugs his shoulders, \"I think it\\\'s because it\\\'s so different to daily life,\" he says. \"It\\\'s exciting.\"People can be surprised by their own response to the films. \"I thought I wouldn\\\'t cry,\" Terumi confesses - she\\\'s a comedian who\\\'s making a documentary about the session. \"But I really cried a lot.\" It was the clips about father and daughter that got her: \"My father\\\'s still alive but I\\\'m over 30 years old\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 still now, I sometimes don\\\'t behave well towards my father,\" she laughs, nervously. \"I started to regret that.\"Not everyone is so moved, though. With a conspiratorial glance over her shoulder, Uria, an employee at the office, asks: \"Is it ok to tell the truth?\" I assure her she can. \"Honestly I\\\'m not interested in this kind of movie. I think there were five or six movies, so many people died. I don\\\'t like it! I don\\\'t think that\\\'s moving. I was not moved.\" The whole premise of Hiroki\\\'s business is the idea that Japanese people don\\\'t cry enough. I wonder if this is a stereotype, but most of today\\\'s attendees seem to agree. \"Japanese people are not really good at expressing their emotions.\" Terumi tells me. \"People working at companies don\\\'t express their opinions or feelings too much.\"  And it is this that drives Hiroki, the company\\\'s founder. \"I want Japanese people to cry,\" he says with real animation. \"Not only at home but in the office. If you cry at work [you think] your co-workers will not want to touch you - there\\\'s a really negative image. \"But I know that after you cry and let people see your vulnerability, you can get along even better with people which is also good for the company. It creates a better working environment and people get along better.\" As I leave, I reflect on a surreal evening. Did I cry? No. However, if I had been able to focus on the films, I think I might have done.

Top A* grades have slipped from 6.6% to 6.5%. This has been blamed on more pupils in England being required to resit English and maths.Schools Minister Nick Gibb said 17-year-olds who had successfully retaken these GCSEs now had \"better prospects\".The results of more than five million GCSE entries in England, Wales and Northern Ireland have been published.This year\\\'s combined figures show a sharp decline in the proportion of grades A* to C and smaller falls in top A* and A grades.Prof Alan Smithers, director of the University of Buckingham\\\'s Centre for Education and Employment Research, said the 2.1 percentage points decline was the biggest drop in A*-C grades since GCSEs were introduced in the late 1980s.This has been driven by a fall in grades in England - as Northern Ireland\\\'s results improved and results in Wales remained stable.The fall in England has been attributed to a policy in England requiring resits in maths and English for 17-year-olds who did not make a C grade last year.Even without these older pupils resitting exams, there has been a fall in the results of 16 year olds, with the proportion getting A* to C declining by 1.3% points.This year\\\'s results were down for maths, English, history and geography. And there were further falls in the numbers of pupils taking modern languages, with the British Council warning that entries for French had more than halved in the past two decades.The National Union of Teachers said the decline in modern languages was exacerbated by the \"difficulty many schools have in recruiting qualified language teachers\". The gender gap has widened further - with 71.3% of entries by girls getting a C grade or above compared with 62.4% of boys.There has been a continuing reduction in the number of pupils taking GCSEs a year early, down by about a quarter compared with last year.League tables now only count the first time a pupil sits an exam, discouraging entries by younger pupils.This will be the last year before the start of a major change in how GCSEs are graded in England and how school performance is measured.A revised set of GCSE exams are going to be graded by numbers - from 9 down to 1 - rather than the current letter-based system in a process that will be phased in from next year.There will also be a new way of assessing schools in England, to be introduced later this year, called Progress 8, which will measure how much progress pupils make in secondary schools, rather than their raw results.Russell Hobby, leader of the National Association of Head Teachers, said: \"GCSE results day is a nervous time for all, as much depends on these grades. \"2016 is worse than ever in this regard as the results are so unpredictable following wave after wave of over hasty changes. Such overwhelming change introduces mistakes and makes it hard to sustain a calm focus on teaching,\" said Mr Hobby.England\\\'s School Standards Minister Nick Gibb said he was \"pleased to see that there are more GCSEs being taken in the core academic subjects, those that give students a wider range of opportunities.\"And for those 17-year-olds who have struggled to achieve good grades in maths, we are seeing 4,000 more successful re-takes of those exams; delivering better prospects for every one of those young people.\\xe2\\x80\\x8e\"Kirsty Williams, Education Secretary in Wales, said: \"This year\\\'s GCSEs show another strong performance with two thirds of our learners achieving at least A*-C and an increase in the top grades.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/education-37175848','2016-08-25 22:30:05','2016-08-25 21:31:17',1),(650,'Camber Sands deaths: Victims underestimated tide, RNLI says','Five men who died at Camber Sands got into trouble after failing to realise how quickly the tide would come in, the RNLI says.','Five men who died at Camber Sands got into trouble after failing to realise how quickly the tide would come in, the RNLI has said.The men were on a day trip to London to the Sussex resort on Wednesday.The RNLI said it did not believe that rip currents were responsible for the deaths.

His spokesman told the BBC they knew of claims of an attempt to \"overthrow\" the government,  describing it as a \"clear breach of international norms\".The Maldives has seen frequent protests amid fears Mr Yameen\\\'s rule could see a return to its repressive past.The luxury tourist destination only became a democracy in 2008 when Mohamed Nasheed became its first freely elected leader, ending three decades of autocratic rule under Mr Yameen\\\'s half-brother, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom.The details of what is being planned remain obscure, but when put to the government they described it as a \"formal attempt at \\\'legally\\\' overthrowing the government\". \"As in every democracy it is the people, via the ballot, who will decide who will next take office,\" a spokesman for the government said. Mr Yameen came to power in 2013. Under his rule, hundreds of political activists have faced charges and several senior figures have been given long jail sentences including Mr Nasheed,  who now lives in self-imposed exile in the UK.But despite heavy restrictions, rallies regularly take place against his rule in the cramped streets of the capital, Male, away from the white sand beaches of tourist resorts.Last Friday, hundreds of opposition activists gathered near the island\\\'s artificial beach, loudspeakers blaring out opposition songs. An image of the president gazed down from a billboard close by. There were some scuffles with police forces, but heavy tropical rains sent most people to shelter. On the other side of the congested island, a weekly protest prayer was being held at a prominent mosque. Many of the protesters agitated during Mr Gayoom\\\'s time in office, pushing for a democratic transition, and are worried about losing  their recently gained freedoms. This month has already seen a strict defamation law come in to force, with stiff punishments for comments or actions considered insulting to Islam or which \"contradict general social norms\", and tighter restrictions on demonstrations. The death penalty is also being reintroduced, after a 60-year unofficial moratorium. The moves have drawn criticism \"It\\\'s the worst it\\\'s been,\" says Zaheena Rasheed, the editor of the Maldives Independent, a prominent English-language news website.She says journalists are finding it increasingly hard to report in the current climate, and even operate at all. Three major news outlets have already closed this year.One of her reporters, and an active blogger, went missing two years ago, and is thought to have been murdered. It is not clear who was responsible. After his abduction, Ms Rasheed received a message saying she would be next, and arrived at her office to find a machete embedded in the door.\"Journalists are already facing death threats, harassments, murder attempts,\" she says. \"Now we are seeing the courts and the laws silence journalists.\"The government defends the new defamation law, saying it seeks to \"safeguard ordinary citizens against baseless allegations\" and encourages a \"higher standard of reporting\".  But instead of bolstering his authority, his critics say the new legislation simply exposed just how threadbare the government\\\'s support really is.  The government has said it remains committed to human rights, and that any legal action is a matter for the judiciary.  But politically, Mr Yameen has become increasingly lonely. He is battling a broad opposition coalition led by his former deputy, Mohamed Jameel, and which includes former President Nasheed, now in exile in the UK.   Meanwhile, his own party has split, with a breakaway faction led by his half-brother and former ally, former President Gayoom.  Last month, Mr Yameen admitted that the break was a \"gift\" to the opposition. \"The people of the Maldives will find a way to get rid of this dictator,\" says Eva Abdulla, an outspoken opposition MP, from her airy apartment in central Male. \"He\\\'s lost all support from within his own political party,\" she says. \"He doesn\\\'t have any kind of support from the independent institutions, he doesn\\\'t have support from the security forces.\"Credible sources have told the BBC that moves will be made against the president soon. \"The feeling is there is no other way out of this,\" one source said. The president\\\'s spokesperson confirmed to the BBC that the \"administration is aware of claims, by those organising outside of the Maldives, of this move. Such a plot is \"disingenuous to the people of the Maldives and in clear breach of international legal norms,\" Mr Ibrahim Shihab said.

It is also pleasing to see the pass rate for the very top grades is up\".Qualifications Wales chief executive Philip Blaker added: \"The overall GCSE results for Wales this summer are stable, with some small shifts which can be considered normal variation.\"In some subjects, performance has improved, such as French, geography and history whereas, in others it has fallen, for example ICT, religious studies and Spanish. \"This is to be expected since cohorts vary from one year to the next, in both size and ability.\" Rebecca Williams, from teaching union Ucac, said: \"Comparisons, both with previous years within Wales, and with other nations in the UK, are going to become increasingly difficult - indeed futile, as the changes work their way through the system.\"She said the Pisa international test results - due again by the end of this year - could become an increasingly important benchmark.\"It\\\'s possible that - for better or for worse - external measures such as Pisa will take on greater importance in measuring educational performance in a comparative context,\" she added.The Conservatives said they were worried about a stagnation in A* to C passes, with the results offering  \"a mishmash of reasons to be both optimistic and downbeat\".','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-37173969','2016-08-25 22:30:05','2016-08-25 18:47:58',1),(660,'Cardiff man arrested in Germany for kidnap plot','A 60-year-old man from Cardiff is arrested in Germany on suspicion of conspiracy to kidnap, police say.','A 60-year-old man from Cardiff has been arrested in Germany on suspicion of conspiracy to kidnap.Gwent Police said the man was arrested in Hamburg on 12 August and will be extradited to the UK.

In pressure situations, they know they are not just being judged by 1,500 people in the ground and on TV in the FA Cup games. They are also being judged by bosses who have won everything you can win in football. But that is why we accepted the offer. It might be the best time of their lives.

Another 46 died in Arquata, and 11 in Accumoli. A further 264 people have been treated in hospital.Officials revised down the number of dead after earlier giving a figure of 247.

There was a ripple of congratulations through the crowd.\"It doesn\\\'t matter to us if it\\\'s a person or an animal, we save it,\" said Gianni Macerata, the fire officer in charge.So the digging goes on.

Many are feared to be in the rubble, though several were pulled out and given medical care.Many of those affected were Italians on holiday in the region. Some were in Amatrice for a festival to celebrate a famous local speciality - amatriciana bacon and tomato sauce.Late on Wednesday there were cheers in the village of Pescara del Tronto when a young girl was pulled alive from the rubble after being trapped for 17 hours.

The Tyrrhenian Basin, or Sea, which lies to the west of Italy, between the mainland and Sardinia/Corsica, is slowly opening up. Scientists say this is contributing to extension, or \"pull-apart\", along the Apennines.  This stress is compounded by movement in the east, in the Adriatic.The result is a major fault system that runs the length of the mountain range with a series of smaller faults that fan off to the sides.

The burkini represented the \"enslavement of women\", he added.Education Minister Najat Vallaud-Belkacem said that while she disapproved of the burkini as a feminist, she saw the bans as unwelcome and objected to the idea that the clothing a woman wore on a beach could have any link to terrorism or jihadist group Islamic State.The controversy has intensified in France after pictures of police appearing to enforce the ban prompted widespread anger, Some of the women pictured in Nice and Cannes were not wearing burkinis.Siam, 34, a mother from Toulouse, was fined \\xe2\\x82\\xac11 (\\xc2\\xa39, $12), although she insists she was not wearing a burkini at the time but leggings, a jacket and a headscarf.\"The policeman told me I had to wear correct clothing and wear the hijab as a headband. But I left the beach and kept my hijab on,\" French daily Liberation Anouar Kbibech, president of the French Council of the Muslim Faith (CFCM), said he was \"concerned over the direction the public debate is taking\", citing the \"growing fear of stigmatisation of Muslims in France\".Most of the beaches where bans have been imposed are on the Riviera in south-east France. However, few are thought to have issued fines other than the authorities at Cannes and Nice, where more than 20 fines have been handed out.France\\\'s Human Rights League (LDH) and the anti-Islamophobia association (CCIF) argue the bans contravene freedom of opinion, religion, clothing and movement. They failed to persuade a court in Nice this week to overturn a ban at Villeneuve-Loubet west of Nice and are taking their case to France\\\'s highest administrative court, the Council of State (Conseil d\\\'Etat).

The largest increase in water has been on the Tibetan Plateau, while the Aral Sea has been the biggest conversion of water to land.The team said many coastal areas have also changed significantly.The research, carried out by the Deltares Research Institute in the Netherlands, is published in the journal Nature Climate Change. The researchers analysed satellite images recorded by Nasa\\\'s Landsat satellites, which have observed the Earth for decades.They were able to monitor changes in the Earth\\\'s surface down to a resolution of 30m, which can be seen on the The team found that vast areas that were once land are now submerged beneath water, with the largest change occurring in the Tibetan Plateau, where melting glaciers are creating huge new lakes.An increase in the number of dams was also boosting water cover, and using the satellite data, the team was able to detect previously unreported constructions.Dr Fedor Baart from Deltares said: \"We started to look at areas that had not been mapped before. \"We knew in Myanmar that several dams were being built, but we were able to see how many. And we also looked at North Korea, and we found dams being built there just north of the border from South Korea.\" Conversely, the researchers also found that even larger areas of water have now become land.The biggest transformation was seen in the Aral Sea in Central Asia. What was once one of the largest lakes in the world has now almost completely dried up after engineers diverted rivers to irrigate agriculture. The researchers said Lake Mead near Las Vegas, which is the largest freshwater supply in the United States, was also losing water, and 222 sq km (85 sq miles) of it was now land. Coastal areas were also analysed, and to the scientists surprise, coastlines had gained more land - 33,700 sq km (13,000 sq miles) - than they had been lost to water (20,100 sq km or 7,800 sq miles).\"We expected that the coast would start to retreat due to sea level rise, but the most surprising thing is that the coasts are growing all over the world,\" said Dr Baart.\"We\\\'re were able to create more land than sea level rise was taking.\"The researchers said Dubai\\\'s coast had been significantly extended, with the creation of new islands to house luxury resorts.\"China has also reconstructed their whole coast from the Yellow Sea all the way down to Hong Kong,\" sid Dr Baart. Some areas, such as the Amazon, saw almost equal amounts of conversion of land to water and vice versa because of the natural movements of the river system.

It was made possible through the use of an ultra-precise instrument called HARPS.This spectrograph, attached to a 3.6m telescope in Chile, detects the very slight wobble induced in a star when circled by a gravitationally bound planet.Its data suggests Proxima b has a minimum mass 1.3 times that of Earth and orbits at a distance of about 7.5 million km from the star, taking 11.2 days to complete one revolution. The distance between the star and its planet is considerably smaller than Earth\\\'s separation from the Sun (149 million km). But Proxima Centauri is what is termed a red dwarf star. It is much reduced in size and dimmer compared with our Sun, and so a planet can be nearer and still enjoy conditions that are potentially as benign as those on Earth.\"This planet is at 5% of the Earth\\\'s distance from the Sun. However, Proxima is 1,000 times fainter than the Sun. So the flux - the energy - reaching Proxima b is about 70% of what the Earth receives. It\\\'s like taking Earth a bit further away, but it\\\'s comparable,\" explained Dr Anglada-Escud\\xc3\\xa9.Whether the temperatures on Proxima b are favourable for life to exist is going to depend on the presence of an atmosphere.An envelope of greenhouse gases would warm surface conditions and provide sufficient pressure to keep water - essential for biology - in a liquid state. But even with the limited information we currently have, scientists are excited by the news.\"I think it\\\'s the most important exoplanet discovery there will ever be - how can you ever trump something that could be habitable orbiting around the very closest star to the Sun?\" commented Dr Carole Haswell from the Open University. \"When I was a kid, it wasn\\\'t clear there were any other planets that we could walk around on and find liquid water on - so I think it\\\'s absolutely thrilling,\" she told BBC News.This is a huge moment in the search for alien worlds. Until 1992, the only planets anyone knew about were the ones in our own solar system. But since then thousands more have been found orbiting distant stars and the belief is that the galaxies may be teeming with them. Most would be extremely inhospitable to life: too big or too hot or too cold. The newly found Proxima b does not sound like much of a paradise either. It is roughly Earth-sized and should be the right temperature for liquid water but it is bathed in sepia light and vulnerable to violent flares so it is definitely not Earth-like. However the fact that it is so close to us - in the relative terms of deep space - suddenly improves the chances of investigating if an exoplanet can be genuinely habitable.So expect this announcement to trigger a mass swivelling of telescopes towards a very particular point in space. In just two decades, astronomers have moved from amazement at finding any new worlds at all to discovering the most tantalising of them all right on their doorstep.Researchers are presently looking to see if the planet crosses the face of Proxima Centauri as viewed from Earth - an event referred to as a \"transit\".This kind of backlit observation could confirm not just the existence of an atmosphere but reveal perhaps something of its chemical properties.  Indeed, researchers have long talked about using transits to try to detect the signatures of life on planets that are too far away to be visited by spacecraft.If there are lifeforms on Proxima b - even simple microbes - they may find the going rather tough, however.Red dwarfs are very active. They tend to throw out big flares that would bombard a nearby planet with energetic particles. The X-ray emission is much more intense as well.Even so, these kinds of stars are now the subject of great interest in the search for Earth-like planets simply because they are so abundant in the galaxy.One priority for the future will be to get a direct image of the planet.This should be possible with the European Extremely Large Telescope It is being given a 39m-wide primary mirror and state-of-the-art instrumentation precisely to do this kind of observation.\"A planet around even a wimpy star like Proxima Centauri is going to be more than a billion times fainter than the star itself. So, what you do is block out the light from the star using a special device and that allows you then to go deeper into the star\\\'s surroundings,\" explained Cambridge University\\\'s Prof Gerry Gilmore. \"This is one of the E-ELT\\\'s design goals.

It was made entirely from different types of silicone gel using a carefully devised combination of moulding and 3D printing.At its heart is a \"fluidic logic circuit\" where valves act as logic gates, allowing gas to flow and inflate compartments inside the eight separate limbs.The gas is pumped into that circuit by a little fuel cell filled with hydrogen peroxide, which reacts with particles of platinum left in the system by the printing process.All Mr Truby and his colleagues had to do - after several years perfecting the design - was to fill the robot with fuel and watch it go.\"We had all the components in place for quite a while, and it took many months trying to bring it all together,\" he said. \"It was back, I guess last October, there was this one day when it just started working. Michael [Wehner, co-first author] and I looked at each other and thought: OK, we finally did it.\"Several iterations later, we kept fine tuning, and at one point we could just take these things out of the oven, fill them up with fuel and they\\\'d start moving.\"The circuit sets up an alternating movement, whereby balloon-like chambers are inflated inside four limbs at a time. The octobot raises four legs and lowers the other four, then swaps. It is a simple demonstration but an important one. \"Right now he\\\'s kind of flopping back and forth, but it\\\'d be nice to create soft robots that know when they\\\'re interacting with their environment - that have more complicated modes of autonomous functionality,\" Mr Truby said.And why make the prototype an octopus? As a tribute, apparently. The animal is devoid of a skeleton but remarkably strong and capable of a baffling variety of movement - so has been a tremendous model for the soft robotics community.\"The octopus itself does not move this way, it is not powered this way,\" Mr Truby explained.\"We\\\'re not necessarily taking inspiration from the octopus itself, but we thought that for... our first embodiment of an entirely soft robot, it needed to have the form of an octopus.\"Jonathan Rossiter, who runs the Researchers around the world, he said, have been working on the various components of an entirely soft robot: inflatable \"muscles\", fuel cells, soft sensors and control systems.\"One thing that\\\'s been missing so far has been putting them all together,\" Prof Rossiter told the BBC, adding that the octobot would be a springboard for others in the field.\"It\\\'s made in a really nice way.

NHS chiefs want local health and council leaders to work together to make the best use of resources at a time when efficiency savings are required.  If that means caring for more people out of hospital and concentrating services at fewer sites then, NHS England would argue, so be it. But closures are never popular at local level and campaigners in each area will no doubt oppose cuts to services. It will be a big moment for the NHS when the final plans are published in the autumn.

One of the report\\\'s authors, former Npower chief executive, Paul Massara - who now runs North Star Solar - said: \"You are looking at a deal which is two and half times the current price, it goes on for 35 years and effectively this report today shows we can transition to a low carbon, affordable secure option without Hinkley and that\\\'s what we should be doing.\"Mr Massara said a more \"flexible\" cost saving approach was needed that \"includes things like demand-side management, which means people can turn down their electricity demand and manage their demand, with smart meters and batteries which are going to come in the next five to six years\".If it goes ahead, it is forecast Hinkley Point C would deliver 7% of the UK\\\'s electricity. The low-carbon electricity it would generate would help towards achieving climate goals. However, the government has guaranteed EDF a fixed price for the electricity it produces for 35 years. That fixed price is \\xc2\\xa392.50 per megawatt hour - nearly double  the current rate. That is expected to push up energy bills for consumers in the long run. The In its report, the not-for-profit ECIU made the assumption that \"the total annual cost of Hinkley will probably be about \\xc2\\xa32.5bn\".It then calculated the cost of a basket of alternative measures to meet the country\\\'s energy and climate change targets, and concluded that bill payers, both domestic and business, would end up paying a total of \\xc2\\xa31bn less per year for their energy if they were adopted than if Hinkley C were built. The think tank\\\'s alternative proposals include building more wind farms and gas-fired power stations than are currently planned and laying more cables connecting the UK grid with other countries.\"Our conclusion is that [Hinkley Point\\\'s] not essential,\" said ECIU director, Richard Black. \"Using tried and tested technologies, with nothing unproven or futuristic, Britain can meet all its targets and do so at lower cost,\" he added.

The P waves arrive first, and can be sensed by seismometers and some animals; the S waves arrive second and do the serious shaking.In the case of microseisms, both signals are faint but P waves have been more straightforward to study. Typhoons in the western Pacific, for example, generate signals that are routinely picked up by scientists in California.Key to finally picking up and pinpointing the more elusive S waves was deploying a big suite of detectors.Kiwamu Nishida from the University of Tokyo and Ryota Takagi of Tohoku University used a network of 202 stations in the Chugoku region of southern Japan.This high-density array allowed them to add up many measurements of the same very faint signals, and eventually trace their source all the way back to the north Atlantic.Peter Bromirski, from the University of California San Diego, was not involved in the research but co-wrote a commentary on it He said that being able to detect both S and P waves from storms would open up more of the Earth to the prying ears of seismologists.\"Most of what we know about the internal structure of the Earth has been determined from studying the way earthquake waves propagate, through the lower crust and the mantle and the core,\" Dr Bromirski told \"In order to do that, you need to have a source that can generate a signal that propagates to your seismic stations. For some reason there are very few earthquakes in the mid Pacific... so we don\\\'t have any sources there.\"These storm-generated P and S wave microseisms will hopefully allow us to better characterise the structure of the Earth below the Pacific.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-37177575','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 18:14:46',1),(729,'Extinct \'lion\' named after Attenborough','A tiny marsupial lion, extinct for at least 18 million years, is named after Sir David Attenborough after fossilised remains are found in remote Australia.','A miniature marsupial lion, extinct for at least 18 million year, has been named after Sir David Attenborough after its fossilised remains were found in a remote part of Australia. Teeth and bone fragments from the kitten-sized predator, named Microleo attenboroughi, were found in limestone deposits at the Riversleigh World Heritage Fossil site in north-western Queensland. The researchers named the new species after the British broadcasting legend because of his work promoting the famous fossil site, which provides a record of nearly 25 million years of Australia\\\'s natural history. When Microleo was still prowling around, in the early Miocene era (roughly 19 million years ago), the arid, outback ecosystem was a lush rainforest.  \"It likely ran through the treetops, gobbling up birds, frogs, lizards and insects,\" says Dr Anna Gillespie, a palaeontologist at the University of New South Wales (UNSW).  Ms Gillespie, who has been working at Riversleigh and preparing fossils for 20 years, helped recover fragments of the animal\\\'s skull and several teeth. It\\\'s far from a complete skeleton, but it\\\'s an important part of the puzzle.\"Crucially, we have got the third premolar, which is an elongated tooth that looks like a blade,\"  she told the BBC. The razor-sharp tooth, used to tear up prey, is a common feature found in all known members of the family. \"It immediately tells us it\\\'s a marsupial lion,\" she says. But the tooth is by far the smallest of its kind ever recovered. It\\\'s about one-tenth the size of the 3cm-long \"bolt-crunching\" teeth belonging to the largest and last surviving marsupial lion, Thylacoleo carnifex, which went extinct about 100,000 years ago.  Thylacoleo weighed about 130kg (286lbs) and was Australia\\\'s largest carnivorous mammal. It was a fearsome predator about the size of an African lion, with the bite strength to match, and hunted megafauna such as giant kangaroo and diprotodon. In sharp contrast, Ms Gillespie and her team estimate that their \"little guy\" weighed only 600g, and was about the size of a kitten. \"We weren\\\'t expecting to find a marsupial lion of this small size,\" she says. \"It might have been a bit too big to fit in your pocket, but it would have fit quite comfortably in a handbag. It would have been very cute.\"  The team has ruled out the possibility that the fossils belonged to a juvenile, or a malformed member of a related species. This is due to their distinctive shape, the fact that all the molars have erupted and the presence of \"very clear wear patterns\".  \"This animal has been running around hunting things for quite a while. So it\\\'s definitely an adult,\" says Dr Gillespie.  The team from UNSW has described the new species in the journal Palaeontologia Electronica. With this find, the researchers have determined that at least three different marsupial lions were co-existing in the ancient Riversleigh rainforest.  \"This level of diversity is unmatched for the family at any other time in their evolutionary history,\" the researchers note. One marsupial lion (Priscileo) weighed about 1.8kg, and was about the size of a cat. Another yet-to-be described species (Wakaleo) weighed around 30kg, about the size of a small Labrador dog, says Ms Gillespie.   She says it indicates that they may have been co-operating, dividing up the food resources to reduce competition between themselves.   The fossil was found in a location at Riversleigh known as Neville\\\'s Garden, which has become renowned for its rich diversity of animals. It\\\'s yielded bandicoots, possums, kangaroos, toothed platypuses, small koalas, thousands of bats, fish, turtles, lizards, pythons and a range of rainforest birds. \"My colleagues have been working at Riversleigh for 40 years,\" says Ms Gillespie. \"In that time we have processed tonnes of limestone, and got thousands and thousands of fossils back, but this is the only specimen from this animal. \"So it\\\'s rather enigmatic in this way,\" she says. \"It might have been a rare species in that ecosystem, but we still have to hunt for more.\" Stephen Wroe, an associate professor of zoology and palaeontology at the University of New England in NSW, who was not involved in the study, says the discovery raises new questions about the origin of the marsupial lion family. \"Until quite recently there were only a few marsupial lion species known. Over the last decade or two evidence from Riversleigh has seen this jump to 11 subspecies,\" he says.\"This most recent find doesn\\\'t just increase the known diversity in terms of species numbers - it greatly expands the diversity of known morphologies.\" Mr Wroe says the team has done a good job estimating the body size: \"No matter how you wash it, this little guy was tiny relative to other members of the family.\" He says its diminutive size may explain why only a single specimen has been found. \"In general Australia\\\'s fossil record is very poor over this time period,\" he says. \"Riversleigh is a freakishly productive area in this respect.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-australia-37182388','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 00:40:42',1),(730,'Man\'s confession after killing partner','A man killed his partner before confessing to his mother days later he had \"done something terrible\", a court is told.','A man killed his partner before confessing to his mother days later he had \"done something terrible\", a court heard.David Anderson strangled 36-year-old Louise O\\\'Brien at their flat in Perth in April.Miss O\\\'Brien\\\'s body was later discovered on a bed with a heart-shaped chocolate beside her.A court was told her family was still too upset to give a victim impact statement.Anderson, 41, had originally faced a murder charge, but prosecutors accepted his guilty plea to a reduced charge of culpable homicide.

When an allergic reaction leads to anaphylactic shock, a shot of epinephrine can literally be the difference between life and death. But now, just as parents are about to send kids with severe food and insect allergies back to school, the EpiPen\\\'s manufacturer is hiking its price to an all-time high,\" she said in a The drugs company has come under fire from leading politicians of both main parties. Though one who has so far not commented is West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin, a Democrat, who is the father of Mylan\\\'s CEO, Heather Bresch - a family connection which some on social media have highlighted. Mylan has also been publicly rebuked by the Sex & The City actress Sarah Jessica Parker, who had previously endorsed EpiPens when she spoke about her son\\\'s peanut allergy. Announcing in an Instagram post that she was ending her association with the company, she wrote: \"I hope they will seriously consider the outpourings of voices of those millions of people who are dependent on the device, and take swift action to lower the price.\"EpiPens are a simple way to deliver a single dose of the hormone epinephrine (more commonly known as adrenaline) which is used to treat potentially life threatening anaphylactic shocks. Epinephrine itself is not an expensive drug, and it can be administered via syringe. But there are concerns that loading and injecting the correct dose can not only take more time in an emergency situation, but can also be potentially dangerous if administered incorrectly. EpiPens are seen as a safe delivery method as they are pre-loaded with a regulated amount of the drug.Yet the precise measurement that the EpiPen provides is under patent protection, restricting cheaper generic alternatives from being brought onto the market. As a result, the company has been widely criticised online for its pricing policies and Heather Bresch. The US price of the pens has risen, from $100 for a pack of two wholesale in 2008 to about $600 this year. While differences in insurance policies vary how much each family will pay for EpiPens, many social media users who need pens available in multiple locations have said this increased cost has proved to be too expensive for them.Earlier this week Mylan\\\'s share price has taken a battering as a result of the negative publicity. But it has now rallied after the company announced on Thursday that it would help reduce the out-of-pocket cost of EpiPens by extending its discount programme to more uninsured and underinsured patients.

Some of those leaving said the town had become uninhabitable.Darayya saw some of the first protests against the Syrian government, an uprising that transformed into a full-blown civil conflict.The withdrawal of rebels just a few miles from Damascus is a boost for President Bashar al-Assad, analysts say.The evacuation comes as US Secretary of State John Kerry holds talks on Syria with his Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov in Geneva.They are meeting in a bid to broker a temporary ceasefire in the city of Aleppo, where fighting between government and rebel forces has escalated in recent weeks, leaving hundreds dead.Russia\\\'s President Vladimir Putin and Turkish counterpart Recep Tayyip Erdogan have agreed a deal to boost aid to Aleppo, Turkish media reported.Russian and American teams in Geneva, involving military officials and diplomats, have been able to reach agreement on most details of a possible deal.

The Home Office said it was \"encouraged\" that so many retailers had been \"denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade\".However, the charity DrugWise said the ban had driven the market underground.Legal highs became popular on the drug scene around 2008. They contain substances which mimic the effects of illegal drugs such as cocaine, cannabis and ecstasy and go by names such as Spice and Black Mamba.Laws criminalising the production, distribution, sale and supply of the drugs - known as the Psychoactive Substances Act - came into effect at the end of May.Commander Simon Bray, from the National Police Chiefs Council, said London\\\'s Metropolitan Police had also seized nearly 14,000 nitrous oxide or laughing gas canisters since the change.Mr Bray said although it was difficult to draw firm conclusions about the impact on use of the drugs, \"intuitively I think it must have had an effect\". \"It will certainly make it less easy for the casual first-time user to get involved in this sort of stuff,\" he said adding that he believed many people were \"lulled into buying these things\" thinking they were legal and therefore safe.The Angelus Foundation, which educates people on the risks of legal highs, said it believed many online traders had also shut down.Jeremy Sare, director of communications at the charity, told the BBC: \"I think the ban has made a big difference and we are supportive of the legislation.\"What we are surprised about is the online supply hasn\\\'t surged. Traders seem to have stopped selling. It is still early days and we may look back in 12 months and see more online trading but many look to have closed.\"Many were operating within the law but now the law has gone against them so they haven\\\'t continued.\"He said the two biggest groups still using the drugs were homeless people and prisoners. Greg, originally from Essex and now living in west Wales, told BBC Radio 5 live about his experience of a legal high known as Holy Smoke.\"I had just a little bit... My head just started spinning and I had this paranoid feeling. I just wanted to go home and hide but I couldn\\\'t walk properly.

Then, in May, the body of his brother Simon, 37, was found next to a packet of the psychoactive substances. Their sister, Melanie Downie, 40, Sarah Newton the government\\\'s safeguarding minister, said the drugs \"have already cost far too many lives\".\"I\\\'m encouraged to see that - three months in - police are using their new powers to take dealers off our streets and that so many retailers have been denied the chance to profit from this reckless trade.\"\"These drugs are not legal, they are not safe and we will not allow them to be sold in this country,\" she added.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37185996','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 14:04:28',1),(766,'St Dogmaels charity to plant 1,000 apple trees near abbey','A charity is set to plant 1,000 apple trees in Pembrokeshire after receiving nearly £250,000 from the Big Lottery Fund.','A charity is set to plant 1,000 apple trees in Pembrokeshire.

However, it said the handbook given to MLAs to guide them in relation to expenses did not match the provisions of a determination made by the independent financial review panel in 2012, covering the purchase of external research and administrative support.The review found that what it terms this \"mismatch\" led to MLAs being paid \\xc2\\xa365,166 between January 2013 and March 2015.The resource accounts say the divergence between the panel\\\'s ruling and the assembly\\\'s handbook \"could be seen to call the regularity of the payments into doubt\".However, the assembly is not seeking to recover any of the cash. It says MLAs submitted their claims \"in good faith\".The assembly sought a legal opinion, and \"on the basis of that legal advice, it has been decided there are no reasonable grounds for seeking recovery\".The document says the handbook on MLA expenses has now been \"completely redrafted\", that there is a new memorandum of understanding,  and more regular contacts between assembly staff and the independent financial review panel.Pat McCartan and the two other members of the independent financial review panel finished their five-year terms of office at the start of July. Currently there is no panel in place.The assembly commission says it is reviewing the present model of administering financial support for members.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37185873','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 13:16:18',1),(788,'Clones Castle rediscovered after 250 years','A 17th Century castle \'lost\' for more than 250 years is rediscovered in the centre of a town on the Irish border.','A 17th century castle \"lost\" for more than 250 years has been rediscovered in the centre of a town on the Irish border.An archaeological excavation in Clones, County Monaghan, had failed to uncover the remains of the castle.But, unknown to the experts the walls of the four-storey building were still standing nearby. The walls were covered in ivy and hidden in undergrowth but there were clues that had been overlooked.It was found behind a Georgian terrace known as Castle Street, which contains a building called Castle House.Monaghan county heritage officer Shirley Clerkin said it shows \"when you start opening your eyes, looking afresh at things, you can rediscover really, really interesting buildings\".  She said although the castle was hidden in plain sight, no one had been really looking for it.\"There had been an excavation done in a southerly direction from here looking for the castle as part of a commercial dig but they didn\\\'t really find any upstanding remains and then we assumed there was no castle here,\" she said. She came across the building a few months ago along with local historian George Knight when they explored an area just a few metres away from the Diamond in the centre of the town. \"We crossed over a lot of barbed wire, a lot of brambles, woody-stuff and we came in front of this building and looked up at the front wall and realised we were standing in front of something potentially very significant,\" she said.\"This building had been re-used as an agricultural building and had been completely forgotten about from the point of view of it being a potential castle candidate.\"I think there was probably a wee bit of folklore around it - kids maybe played here when they were young and pretended it was a castle and they were absolutely right, it is a castle.\" George Knight said he was aware the building existed but experts had previously dismissed it \"with a cursory glance\" as being \"of no great historical importance\".\"It has been used as a rubbish dump for many years. The joists carrying the first floor, only one is still in place the rest have collapsed down,\" he said.\"We think the original slate roof has probably collapsed down into the building as well.\" The fortified house is thought to have been built in the 1600s by the local landlords, the Lennard-Barret family, who may only have lived in it for 50 years until the outbreak of the Jacobite wars in 1688.It is shown on a 1741 drawing of Clones in the collection of the National Library in Dublin along with the town\\\'s other historical landmarks. \"Clones has a lot of historical depth to it We already have early Christian sites here, we have an Augustinian abbey, a motte and bailey from Norman times and this is the next piece of the jigsaw,\" Shirley Clerkin said.\"We have what we believe here to be a remnant of the plantation castle that we can see on the 1741 drawing. \"It means that Clones really has got little bits of every period in Irish history upstanding in the town.\"Local volunteers have been cutting back some of the undergrowth to reveal more of the building, including the musket slits, fortified door, corbels and wooden floor beams. An open day has been held for people to come and see the castle and learn more about its history.Archaeologists will return to Clones to carry out excavations involving the local community to see what other artefacts can be unearthed. George Knight said the discovery has become the talk of the town and people were keen to learn more about the history hidden on their doorstep.\"It really is a missing link in the story of Clones, a unique building and something that we\\\'re very keen to preserve for future generations,\" he said. \"We hope that any artefacts found will remain here in Clones and the building and the artefacts associated with it will tell the full story and the history of what happened within these walls.\" Shirley Clerkin is convinced that there are more discoveries to be made.\"I think this place has got unlimited potential,\" she said.\"We already have two tunnels, we have one under the staircase here and we have one in the wall outside and there\\\'s lots of legends of tunnels in Clones, so I think maybe this is one of those little links and it\\\'s a tantalising glimpse of the past.\" ','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-37186135','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 17:31:39',1),(789,'Rory McIlroy is five off pace at Barclays event in New York after opening 71','Rory McIlroy is five off the pace at The Barclays event in the US after an opening level-par 71 at Bethpage Black.','Rory McIlroy is five off the pace at The Barclays event in the US after an opening level-par 71 at Bethpage Black in New York.The world number five missed a couple of short putts in his round as he played his first competitive outing following a change of putter.After starting on 10, bogeys on the 15th and 16th dropped him to two over before he battled back to one under.However, a missed short putt at the eighth brought him back to level par.Graeme McDowell is sharing 51st place, one behind McIlroy, after carding three birdies and four bogeys in his round.The 2010 US Open champion finished his round on a high as he birdied the short 18th.Scotland\\\'s Martin Laird and American Patrick Reed lead the field after rounds of 66.The two leaders are a stroke ahead of Americans Rickie Fowler, Kevin Chappell and JB Holmes plus Argentina\\\'s Emiliano Grillo.World number one Jason Day is among a group two off the pace.The Barclays tournament is the first event in the PGA Tour\\\'s play-offs series.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/golf/37192402','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 22:29:29',1),(790,'Silverbridge: Investigation launched after man dies on County Armagh farm','A man dies after an incident on a farm in Silverbridge, County Armagh.','A man in his 70s has died after an incident on a farm in County Armagh.The man died at a farm in Silverbridge on Thursday afternoon.

I felt really scared and nervous because it was my first time.\"Maria, not her real name, now carries out contract killings as part of the government-sanctioned war on drugs. She is part of a hit team that includes three women, who are valued because they can get close to their victims without arousing the same suspicion a man would.Since I asked her who gave the orders for these assassinations: \"Our boss, the police officer,\" she said.On the very afternoon we met, she and her husband had been told their safe house had been exposed. They were moving in a hurry. This controversial drug war has brought her more work, but more risk too. She described how it began when her husband was commissioned to kill a debtor by a policeman - one who was also a drug pusher. \"My husband was ordered to kill people who had not paid what they owed.\" This turned into a regular commission for her husband until a more challenging situation cropped up. \"One time, they needed a woman... my husband tapped me to do the job. When I saw the man I was supposed to kill, I got near him and I shot him. \"Maria and her husband come from an impoverished neighbourhood of Manila and had no regular income before agreeing to become contract killers. They earn up to 20,000 Philippines pesos ($430; \\xc2\\xa3327) per hit, which is shared between three or four of them. That is a fortune for low-income Filipinos, but now it looks as if Maria has no way out.Contract killing is nothing new in the Philippines. But the hit squads have never been as busy as they are now. President Duterte has sent out an unambiguous message.Ahead of his election, he promised to kill 100,000 criminals in his first six months in office.And he has warned drug dealers in particular: \"Do not destroy my country, because I will kill you.\" Last weekend he reiterated that blunt view, as he defended the extrajudicial killings of suspected criminals.\"Do the lives of 10 of these criminals really matter? If I am the one facing all this grief, would 100 lives of these idiots mean anything to me?\"What has provoked the Mr Duterte describes it as a pandemic, afflicting millions of his fellow citizens. It is also very profitable. He has listed 150 senior According to the police more than In practice most will remain unexplained. Nearly all those whose bloodied bodies are discovered every night in the slums of Manila and other cities are the poor - pedicab drivers, casual labourers, the unemployed. Often, found next to them are cardboard signs warning others not to get involved in drugs. This is a war being fought almost exclusively in the poorest parts of the country. People like Maria are used as its agents. But it is a popular war. In Tondo, the shantytown area next to Manila port, most of the residents applaud the president\\\'s tough campaign. They blamed the \"shabu\" scourge for rising crime, and for destroying lives, although some worried that the campaign was getting out of hand, and that innocent victims were being caught up in it. One of those being hunted by the death squads is Roger - again not his real name.He became addicted to shabu as a young man, he says, while working as a casual labourer. Like many addicts he began dealing to support his habit, as it was a more comfortable job than labouring. He worked a lot with corrupt police officers, sometimes taking portions of the drug hauls they confiscated in raids to sell.Now he is on the run, moving from place to place every few days to avoid being tracked down and killed.\"Every day, every hour, I cannot get the fear out of my chest. It\\\'s really tiring and scary to hide all the time. You don\\\'t know if the person right in front of you will inform on you, or if the one facing you might be a killer. It\\\'s hard to sleep at night. One small noise, I wake up. And the hardest part of all is I don\\\'t know who to trust, I don\\\'t know which direction to go every day, looking for a place to hide.\"He does feel guilt about his role in the trade of this destructive drug.\"I do truly believe that I have committed sins. Big time. I have done many awful things. I\\\'ve wronged a lot people because they\\\'ve become addicted, because I\\\'m one of the many who sells them drugs.

He estimates that between 30% and 35% of people in his neighbourhood are addicts.So when President Duterte stated several times during his presidential campaign that he would kill drug dealers, throw their bodies into Manila Bay, did Roger not take that threat seriously?\"Yes, but I thought he would go after the big syndicates who manufacture the drugs, not the small time dealers like me. I wish I could turn the clock back. But it is too late for me. I cannot surrender, because if I do the police will probably kill me.\"Maria also regrets the choice she has made. \"I feel guilty and it is hard on my nerves. I don\\\'t want the families of those I have killed to come after me.\"She worries about what her children will think. \"I do not want them to come back at us and say that they got to live because we killed for money.\" Already her older boy asks questions about how she and her husband earn so much. She has one more hit, one more contract to fulfill, and would like that to be her last. But her boss has threatened to kill anyone who leaves the team. She feels trapped. She asks her priest for forgiveness at confession in church, but does not dare to tell him what she does. Does she feel any justification carrying out President Duterte\\\'s campaign to terrorise the drug trade into submission?\"We only talk about the mission, how to carry it out,\" she says. \"When it is finished we never talk about it again.\"But she wrings her hands as she speaks and keeps her eyes shut tight, pursued by thoughts she does not want to share.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-37172002','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 07:12:48',1),(795,'Czech hiker describes \'harrowing\' 30-day ordeal in NZ','A Czech hiker who went missing a month ago in the snowy mountains of New Zealand describes the \"harrowing\" 30-day ordeal in which her partner died.','A Czech hiker who went missing a month ago in the snowy mountains of New Zealand has described the \"harrowing\" ordeal in which her partner died.Pavlina Pizova said she and Ondrej Petr began hiking the Routeburn track in Fiordland National Park on 26 July, but got lost in bad conditions.After one night in the open, Petr, 27, slipped in a steep ice slope and died, Ms Pizova told reporters.She said she spent the night with his body before moving on to find shelter.She then stayed in a hut for almost a month.Ms Pizova was found by a search team near Lake Mackenzie on Wednesday.

About 100 \"hotspots\" were detected on Friday.The fires are said to be caused by corporations as well as small-scale farmers using slash-and-burn to clear vegetation for palm oil, pulp and paper plantations. Once lit, the fires often spin out of control and spread into protected forested areas and peat.  A peat fire is difficult to put out as it can burn underground for months, and requires a lot of water to extinguish. At its largest the annual haze measures hundreds of kilometres across. It spreads to Malaysia, Singapore, the south of Thailand and the Philippines, causing a significant deterioration in air quality. The problem has accelerated in recent years as more land has been cleared for expanding plantations for the lucrative palm oil trade.Indonesia says it has arrested 450 people so far this year in connection with fires, including some linked to companies. President Joko Widodo has ordered extra resourcing for monitoring and fire-fighting efforts, but Besides irritating the respiratory tract and the eyes, the pollutants can cause serious long-term damage to health.The indices used to measure air quality in the region usually measure particulate matter (PM10), fine particulate matter (PM2.5), sulphur dioxide, carbon monoxide, nitrogen dioxide and ozone.PM2.5 can enter deeper into the lungs.

The allegation was that money moved invisibly - and illegally - between the 60 subsidiaries, and from company accounts to personal accounts of family members.The dead man was a loyal servant of the family and the company, privy to its secrets. South Korean media said he left a suicide note saying the chairman for whom he worked was innocent of wrong-doing.South Korea has the highest rate of suicide among the industrialised OECD countries.

The high court in Mumbai said the ban \"violated the constitution\" and was discriminatory to women, lawyers said.The ban was imposed in 2012 when the trust that runs the Sufi shrine said it was a \"sin\" to allow women to touch the tombs of male saints.In recent months, India has seen a number of campaigns to allow women into religious shrines that bar their entry.Although women were allowed into the compound and other parts of the Haji Ali mosque, the 2012 ban barred them from entering the inner sanctum which housed the tomb of a Sufi saint.Many Islamic mosques belonging to the Shia and Sunni sects, also allow women, though many keep them in clearly demarcated areas.Activists - both Hindu and Muslim - have dragged patriarchal managements of shrines to courts all across India.Friday\\\'s order is being seen as a big boost for other campaigns to allow women entry into other places of worship.The Mumbai court ruling, however, does not mean that women will be able to enter the Haji Ali shrine immediately as the high court has put its order on hold for six weeks to allow the shrine authorities to appeal in the Supreme Court.Zakia Soman of the rights group Bharatiya Muslim Mahila Andolan (BMMA), which had challenged the ban on women entering the 15th Century shrine in the high court, has praised the \"landmark\" ruling, describing it as a \"huge victory for us\" .\"The shrine management is challenging the high court order in the Supreme Court and we are fine with that. It\\\'s a democratic country and they have the right to do that. But I\\\'m confident of a win there too,\" she told the BBC.\"This is nothing but patriarchy in the name of religion. And it\\\'s high time their bluff is called,\" she added.Mrs Soman said Sufi shrines across the country, and globally, allow women into the sanctum and that until the ban, they were allowed to touch the tomb of the saint at Haji Ali.Sufi Islam is \"a humanist Islam which stands for peace, brotherhood, harmony and love\" and that shrines of Sufi saints have \"much larger appeal\" and are visited by people from all religions and genders, Mrs Soman says.\"Any attempt to keep people out has to be challenged and fought,\" she adds.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-india-37193266','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 17:29:00',1),(800,'Kashmir: \'No sedition evidence\' against Amnesty over Bangalore event','Police say they have no evidence to charge Amnesty International with sedition after some people allegedly raised \"anti-India\" slogans at its event recently.','Police in India say they have no evidence to charge Amnesty International with sedition after some people allegedly raised \"anti-India\" slogans at its event recently.Amnesty said its event in Bangalore aimed \"to seek justice for human rights violations\" in Kashmir.

Team-mate Kimi Raikkonen was 0.2secs further back in seventh place and behind Sergio Perez, and the four-time champion was 0.9secs off the pace.Ferrari\\\'s pace did little to diminish the sense of a team in crisis that has increasingly enveloped them this year as their performance has slumped, in addition to the departure of their highly regarded technical director James Allison last month.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/formula1/37195868','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 22:30:55',1),(806,'County Championship: Yorkshire beat Nottinghamshire to boost title bid','Yorkshire close to within five points of Championship leaders Middlesex by wrapping up a 305-run win over Nottinghamshire.','Champions Yorkshire moved to within five points of Division One leaders Middlesex by wrapping up a 305-run win over Nottinghamshire.Bottom side Notts, who began the day on 61-3 in pursuit of an unlikely 452 to win at Scarborough, lost Tom Moores in the first over the day.They never recovered as Tim Bresnan finished with 5-36 and Jack Brooks 4-35 as Notts were bowled out for 146.Defeat leaves Notts deep in relegation trouble with only three games left.Yorkshire, who are chasing a third successive County Championship title, and Middlesex have four games to play and meet at Lord\\\'s in this season\\\'s final round of matches next month.A Yorkshire victory looked unlikely when they slumped to 51-6 on the opening morning after being put in by Notts captain Chris Read.But a fourth win of the season never looked in doubt after they recovered to post 282 in their first innings before skittling the visitors for only 94.Moores, who resisted Yorkshire\\\'s bowlers on day three for an unbeaten 41, fell to the fourth ball of the final morning when he edged Bresnan to Adam Lyth at second slip.Bresnan removed Samit Patel and Chris Read in quick succession to complete his first five-wicket haul of the summer before Yorkshire wrapped up victory shortly after lunch.Ryan Sidebottom had Ben Hutton caught behind off the third ball after the interval, and in the next over Brooks had Brendan Taylor caught at cover and bowled Luke Fletcher with successive balls.Imran Tahir survived the hat-trick ball but soon became the last man to fall when he fended Brooks to Alex Lees at short leg.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/cricket/37191567','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 22:31:01',1),(807,'Mustafi & Perez set for Arsenal medicals as £50m-plus double deal nears','Germany defender Shkodran Mustafi and Spanish striker Lucas Perez will have medicals at Arsenal on Friday.','Germany defender Shkodran Mustafi and Spanish striker Lucas Perez will have medicals at Arsenal on Friday.The Gunners have reached a deal with Valencia for 24-year-old centre-back Mustafi, who is set to sign a five-year contract for a fee in excess of £35m.They had already agreed to meet a 20m euro (£17.1m) clause to sign Deportivo La Coruna forward Perez, 27, who scored 17 goals in 37 games last season.The deals would take Arsenal\\\'s spending to almost £100m since last season.They have already added midfielders Granit Xhaka and Kelechi Nwakali, defender Rob Holding and forward Takuma Asano to their squad.Everton were closing in on Lucas before Arsenal declared their interest.Gunners boss Arsene Wenger has said he is Speaking on Friday, the Frenchman said the club was \"working on deals\" and he was \"99% confident\" they would be concluded before the transfer window closes at 23:00 BST on 31 August.\"It was a strange transfer market,\" said Wenger. \"I expected it to be easier than ever but it has been more difficult than ever.\"It looks like it will be frenetic in the last three days.

Who are they and what do they believe?','A disparate group of provocateurs is challenging conservative orthodoxy from the right. They hate political correctness and love Donald Trump - but their critics say they\\\'re nothing but bigoted white nationalists.There was a moment when the phrase \"alt-right\" first started to get real traction in the mainstream media. It began with a tweet by US Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump. It showed an image of his opponent, Hillary Clinton, alongside a six-pointed star containing the words: \"Most Corrupt Candidate Ever!\"It wasn\\\'t long before Trump\\\'s critics The candidate himself denied the allegations - although he deleted the tweet, later reposting the image with a circle replacing the star.Anthony Smith, a journalist for the website Mic, got a tip that the image had appeared on 8chan, an extreme message board with many users who self-identify as members of the alt-right movement. At first Smith was sceptical that he\\\'d be able to stand the story up. The message board is fast-moving, threads get deleted quickly, and it\\\'s difficult to search for and find images. But within an hour, he had his answer.\"Sure enough I found it, and I was able to confirm that it was on this board before it was on Trump\\\'s Twitter feed,\" he says. Smith\\\'s story was picked up by the BBC and other news outlets, and many picked up on the link between the image and the amorphous movement known as the alt-right. But what is it, what do its members believe, and what influence are they having on mainstream politics? As a disparate, mostly online phenomenon that lacks a cohesive structure or any sort of central organisation, it\\\'s tough to pin down. But observers of the movement - both critics and supporters - agree on a few things.The alt-right is against political correctness and feminism. It\\\'s nationalist, tribalist and anti-establishment. Its followers are fond of internet pranks and using provocative, often grossly offensive messages to goad their enemies on both the right and the left. And many of them are huge supporters of Donald Trump.Hear more about the alt-right on In a speech last night, Hillary Clinton lambasted Trump for his ties to Iain Davis, who lives in Surrey and runs several alt-right social media accounts, says the movement includes a whole range of people, from libertarians, men\\\'s rights activists, Christians and traditionalists - as well as neo-nazis. \"There\\\'s all these ideas happening in there,\" says Davis. \"This community works over multiple different social media platforms and networks, and there are all sorts of figures and faces involved in it.\"They can be particularly vicious towards their perceived enemies. According to Time magazine \"trolling has become the main tool of the alt-right\". They pejoratively call liberals \"social justice warriors\" or SJWs, and establishment conservatives are dubbed \"cuckservatives\" - a portmanteau that Davis says his opposition to immigration from Muslim countries drew him into the movement, and he is an enthusiastic participant in many online spats. \"SJWs will ostracise you, they are very happy to call you \\\'racist\\\' in their own tight definition of the word, find out where you live, find out who you work for, and make sure your employer gets you fired,\" he says. \"We are very interested in seeing this kind of behaviour ended. That\\\'s one of the things that I like about the alt-right, we are responding to this online bullying, even though we get accused of this online bullying ourselves.\" As a nebulous movement, exact numbers are hard to come by, but Smith, the journalist, traces the alt-right to In it, Gottfried called for \"an independent intellectual Right, one that exists without movement establishment funding\" and declared: \"Our group is also full of young thinkers and activists, and if there is to be an independent Right, our group will have to become its leaders.\"\"At its core it identified black radicalism, radical feminists, open borders activists, these are the enemies, the enemy is progressive society, the enemy is political correctness,\" Smith says. \"From there in the wake of America electing its first black president, all of a sudden you see these people rising from the shadows and organising in a way they haven\\\'t organised before.\"Perhaps Gottfried did not imagine that his idea would be taken up by a merry band of social-media savvy pranksters. One of the alt-right\\\'s figureheads today is Milo Yiannopoulos, technology editor for the website Breitbart. Yiannopoulos is a huge fan of provocation - he hosted a somewhat In a Yiannopoulos acknowledges that the alt-right has attracted some out-and-out racists - but he denies that this is a main theme of the movement\\\'s political philosophy. White supremacists are a marginal force, he argues, and culture and specifically Western civilisation, he insists, are the key motivators for the group. \"The real racists\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 are very serious, are deep into studies and data attempting to prove that some races are smarter than other races - they\\\'re really dorky,\" he says.Yiannopoulos and other commentators on the alt-right consistently attack the sort of \"identity politics\" that they say are perpetuated by liberals.\"If the left insists on breaking people up like this, then yeah, why can\\\'t white guys say, you know what, we did most of the good stuff in the world.\"But critics point out the contradiction in this approach. \"So the answer is to replicate that (racial) obsession and extend it to white people? That\\\'s ridiculous,\" says Cathy Young, a libertarian columnist and writer. \"The alt-right is going to alienate a lot of reasonable critics of political correctness who are going to see the anti-PC rebellion as associated with these white-identity people.\"Oliver Lee Bateman is a freelance journalist, and in the course of writing for Vice Magazine he got to know two dozen or so alt-right activists in the US. From that sample, he developed a rough profile of alt-right activists. \"They\\\'re college students who might be bright but don\\\'t feel like they fit in or they feel like they\\\'ve been put upon,\" he says. \"If they\\\'re in their 30s, they feel like the country is changing or they\\\'re losing their country. They\\\'re often people who work completely boring bureaucratic or programming jobs. They don\\\'t want to put their names or faces out there.\"I quickly realised that the folks I was talking to were among the most articulate and educated in this group. But there\\\'s a level below them, they\\\'re running these gross hate group pages,\" Bateman says. \"And when Trump came along and began saying things like I\\\'m going to build a wall, or that Saddam Hussein was a good guy, he killed terrorists, they liked that.\"The movement has branches in other countries too, including the UK, albeit on a smaller scale. \"It\\\'s nowhere near as big as the American scene,\" says Iain Davis. \"And I\\\'m not surprised, because we are the nation that fought fascism, we pride ourselves on the fact we went and bashed Hitler. And it\\\'s [the alt-right] always going to be associated with a National Socialist element, when in truth we\\\'re closer to the kind of conservatism that was around 30 or 40 years ago.\" The movement has gained attention in parallel with Trump the politician - so the big question is, will it survive if Trump loses? Yiannopoulos argues the alt-right is bigger than one man. \"The vast majority of people in this movement believe in principle over ethnicity, freedom of speech, libertarianism and free intellectual inquiry.  If the effect of Trump and the effect of the alt-right is to make the unsayable sayable again, wonderful.\"Orthodox conservatives will take heart from the victory of US House Speaker Paul Ryan over businessman Paul Nehlen by a wide margin in the Republican primary for the speaker\\\'s district. Ryan accused his opponent of belonging to the alt-right while attacking Nehlen\\\'s rhetoric as \"dark, grim, indefensible\". But Trump\\\'s victory suggests the establishment have little room for complacency.\"The alt-right probably is here to stay,\" says Young. \"I think that after Trump, it may recede to a more marginal role.\"But after everything that\\\'s happened this year, I have completely given up on making any kind of predictions.\"','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-37021991','2016-08-26 22:21:03','2016-08-26 07:20:18',1),(820,'Quiz of the week\'s news','The Magazine\'s weekly quiz of the news, 7 days 7 questions.','It\\\'s the weekly news quiz - have you been paying attention to what\\\'s been going on in the world over the past seven days?

Researchers were alerted to a vulnerability, investigated it, and made Apple, the company responsible for fixing it, aware so it could issue a fix. Apple, to its credit, understood the severity and acted quickly - it took them just 10 days. These types of vulnerabilities are rare and extremely lucrative. A genuine \"zero day\" - the name given to previously unknown security flaws - can be sold for upwards of $1m when it affects a major piece of software like Apple\\\'s iOS. In this case, it looks like several zero days were combined to make a hugely sophisticated attack package. Now attention is shifting to the secretive organisation said to be behind the attack, the NSO Group, described by researchers as a cyber arms dealer, and described by itself as firm capable of being a \"ghost\" on victims\\\' devices - working undetected but gathering enormous amounts of private data. According to Privacy International, NSO Group has sold its products to clients in Mexico and in Panama - but little is known about other deals involving the company which is said to be worth more than $1bn. Pressure is also being put on Francisco Partners Ltd, the San Francisco-based venture capital firm that has a controlling stake in NSO Group. It is yet to comment on the controversial attack.NSO has issued a statement acknowledging that it makes technology used to \"combat terror and crime\" but said it had no knowledge of any particular incidents and made no reference to the specific spyware involved.\"These are rather rare zero-day flaws,\" commented security expert Prof Alan Woodward, referring to the technical name for previously unknown vulnerabilities.\"To have several found at once is even rarer. As can be seen from how these have been exploited to date, it represents a serious threat to the security and privacy of iOS users. \"Apple has been remarkably responsive in providing fixes for these issues, so I would encourage any iOS users to update to the latest version of the operating system.\"For its part, Apple has limited itself to saying: \"We were made aware of this vulnerability and immediately fixed it with iOS 9.3.5.

Ten percent of the proceeds will go to the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society, based in New York, Charitybuzz said. The winning bidders, Glenn and Shannon Dellimore, said they want to take the computer into schools and universities to help inspire young people. Mr Dellimore told the BBC: \"It is incredible to think that this was most likely the very first Apple 1, the unicorn or holy grail of computers, the original very first prototype.\" No more than 70 Apple 1 computers are believed to still be in existence. The machine - initially named \"Apple Computer 1\" - first went on sale in July 1976, and was discontinued in October of the following year when the company turned its attention to building the Apple 2. The \"celebration edition\" is different from the other Apple 1s because it was manually soldered on to a blank PC board, meaning it was not part of the only two production runs of the device. Mr Wozniak was quoted by Charitybuzz as saying: \"Only a few Apple 1s, on blank (not green) PC boards, may have been manually soldered, although I\\\'m not sure of it. \"We arranged the wave soldering with the company that made the PC boards. But we may not have wanted to wave solder a run (of maybe 10 or more board) until we manually soldered one or two to debug them.\"Apple historian Corey Cohen, who assessed the machine, said in a promotional video that the celebration edition is \"one of the first, if not the first, Apple computers because this appears to be one of the sample boards\".

But the two big powers have to persuade the many different groups now fighting, and that is clearly proving difficult.Mr Kerry reminded journalists of the image, widely shared on social media, of a five-year-old boy sitting dazed in an ambulance after an air strike in Aleppo, saying \"that image needs to motivate all of us, to get the job done\".Mr Kerry said the Syrian government, with the help of its allies including Russia, continued to breach the terms of an existing cessation of hostilities agreement. \"Aleppo continues to be besieged and bombarded by the regime and its allies, including Iran, Russia and Hezbollah, and the regime just today forced the surrender of Darayya after a brutal four years of siege,\" he said.He was speaking hours after the first buses left Darayya, accompanied by ambulances and Red Crescent vehicles.The UN has expressed concern over the plan, saying it is essential that those leaving do so voluntarily.The Syrian army encircled Darayya in 2012 and just one aid delivery has reached the town since then.Opposition fighters are due to be given safe passage to the rebel-held city of Idlib, while civilians are going to government shelters in Damascus.The withdrawal of rebels just a few miles from Damascus is a boost for President Bashar al-Assad, analysts say.For years those living in Darayya have endured constant shelling, as well as suffering shortages of food, water and electricity. Some of those leaving said the town had become uninhabitable.Darayya saw some of the first protests against the Syrian government, an uprising that transformed into a full-blown civil conflict.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-37202043','2016-08-27 07:53:41','2016-08-27 06:18:01',1),(829,'Five men arrested by West Midlands anti-terror police','Five men are arrested by West Midlands anti-terrorism police and an army bomb disposal team is sent to the Lee Bank area of Birmingham as a \"precaution\".','Five men have been arrested by West Midlands anti-terrorism police.Police said an army bomb disposal team had been sent to Birmingham\\\'s Lee Bank area as a \"precautionary measure\" as a result of one of the arrests.Two men, aged 32 and 37, were arrested in the Stoke area of Staffordshire.

A fresh attempt to prosecute him was halted by his death in December last year. But the ongoing independent national inquiry into child sexual abuse in England and Wales has identified the Janner case as Daniel Janner QC, himself a criminal barrister, told the BBC the child abuse inquiry was wrongly focusing one of its most high-profile investigations on a man who was now dead, had never been convicted, and could not defend himself.He has prepared a submission for the Home Affairs Select Committee, which will question the former chairwoman of the inquiry, Dame Lowell Goddard, and Home Secretary Amber Rudd, next month.He and his two sisters, Marion Janner and rabbi Laura Janner-Klausner, are furious that the inquiry will consider their father\\\'s past, as part of an investigation of potential \"institutional failings\" within Leicestershire social services.A review of the case by retired High Court judge Sir Richard Henriques found opportunities had been missed and the Labour veteran should have been charged. But Daniel Janner says he has been told that under the terms of the inquiry, the family could only question those who accuse Lord Janner \"sparingly\", rather than subjecting them to a full cross-examination. \"This process actually discredits the important work of the inquiry\", he said, \"This makes a mockery of justice.\"He said the inquiry was \"working on an assumption of guilt\".Dozens of people are considering suing the estate of Lord Janner, and Daniel Janner said it was right that the civil courts should hear their evidence, ahead of the inquiry.\"Our family has decided this is what we want, to use such inheritance as there is to clear his name,\" he said.The family believes Lord Janner is innocent and that all of the 33 men and women who have accused Lord Janner have fabricated their accounts.Daniel Janner said the earliest claims, investigated by three police inquiries, were \"rubbish\".He believes they prompted others to make allegations, tempted by the prospect of compensation and \"bolstered by the weight of numbers\". Some, he claimed, had colluded to falsify their accounts.  \"I have no doubt that some of them have been abused and of course, my heart goes out to them but they were not abused by my father and it is here where we have to fight back because these are false allegations.\" However Liz Dux, who represents some of those accusing Lord Janner, said there was a risk a court would not be able to rule on the truth of the allegations because of legal time limits for bringing a civil action.  She said the inquiry would have decided to consider the case regardless of whether Lord Janner was prosecuted. Peter Saunders, one those representing child abuse victims within the inquiry, said it was vital the Janner case was fully investigated.','http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-37207475','2016-08-28 10:46:11','2016-08-28 09:18:56',1),(865,'Theresa May launches race audit of public services','Theresa May orders a review to expose any inequalities in the way ethnic minorities and white working class people are treated by public services such as the NHS, schools and the criminal justice system.','Prime Minister Theresa May has ordered a review into how ethnic minorities and white working class people are treated by public services such as the NHS, schools, police and the courts.The audit is aimed at highlighting racial and socio-economic disparities and showing how outcomes differ due to background, class, gender and income.The prime minister said the findings would \"shine a light on injustices\".A recent report found racial inequality remained \"entrenched\" in Britain.The Equality and Human Rights Commission, which Entering Downing Street for the first time as prime minister last month, Mrs May acknowledged not everyone was treated equally in society and there were too many cases of \"burning injustices\" arising from people\\\'s race and background.In her first announcement since returning from her summer holiday, Mrs May ordered government departments to identify and publish details of the varying experiences and outcomes of different groups when using public services.The information, which will be published within a year and updated annually after that, will cover health, education, employment, welfare, skills and criminal justice.Downing Street said the audit would be unprecedented in its scope and transparency, enabling the public to hold public services to account and force improvements.

Alongside Davies, Sam Clucas impressed in midfield, while Adama Diomande and Abel Hernandez chased hard to make something from the few scraps in attack.Before Meyler\\\'s late wasted chance, Tom Huddlestone saw a shot deflect just wide with David De Gea hopelessly wrong-footed as they briefly threatened a smash-and-grab victory.But, after wins over Leicester and Swansea in their opening two games, their 100% start to their top-flight campaign is over. The uncertainty over the club\\\'s future might also be at an end, however, with vice-chairman Ehab Allam writing in the programme that the match could be his family\\\'s last as owners, with takeover talks with a Chinese consortium well advanced.That deal may free up funds to supplement the Tigers\\\' threadbare squad - Tottenham\\\'s Ryan Mason is a target - and help them continue to defy the Premier League\\\'s usual rules of gravity.\"The Hull players are good players, and good people.

All I can do is to aim as high as possible. A podium feels unlikely but it\\\'s not impossible.\"Hamilton said his attempt to fight back through the field would be made more difficult by the fact that the Pirelli tyres are not lasting at the Spa-Francorchamps track.There are unexpectedly high temperatures at the fast and demanding circuit in the Ardennes mountains this year and high tyre pressures chosen by Pirelli to protect against failures following two high-speed blowouts at last year\\\'s race are exacerbating the situation.\"With these tyres the way they are, which is a bit of a mess, it is going to be tough out there for everyone,\" Hamilton said. \"It\\\'s a long race. I don\\\'t have to go crazy at the start. That\\\'s the same whenever we start at the back.\"There were failures last year and they didn\\\'t want failures this year so they put the pressures up to 23, 24psi whatever it is. It\\\'s so high. I have never seen pressures like that my whole racing career. That doesn\\\'t help.\"Hamilton said the problems caused by the tyres would make chasing other cars more difficult. The Pirellis overheat and lose grip if a driver follows another car closely. This has the corollary of reducing the number of laps the tyres can manage.\"It is going to be a very, very hard race,\" he said. \"Being this hot it is going to be hard to follow. Being in the traffic it is going to be hard to get to my stop target, or go longer than the guys in front of me.\"But I hope I prove myself wrong and I hope I\\\'m pleasantly surprised.\"Hamilton\\\'s remarks on the tyres were echoed by McLaren driver Jenson Button, who said the pressures were \"unbelievably high\".\"It is amazing what we have to do to get the tyres in the working window,\" said Button, who starts ninth.\"If you push on the out lap (from the pits), they are done by turn three, blistering and overheating. What we have to do is crazy. I have never had to do this in my career before. \"It\\\'s the pressures. It\\\'s not helped by the temperatures, but we go to hot countries and Pirelli know that. \"It is shame we are so high on the pressures because we are in a position at the moment with the tyre where you can\\\'t push the car.
